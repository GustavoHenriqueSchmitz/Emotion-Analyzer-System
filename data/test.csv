"Like many a child born in the 1980's, I grew up on the Mel Brooks films that weren't necessarily the 'racier' ones like Blazing Saddles and History of the World part 1 (I saw those, of course, though not as frequently as now), but the ones meant for the ""whole family"", Spaceballs, and this film. I knew at the time I wasn't seeing great art, but just a campy, goofy, though always laugh-worthy take on Robin Hood and/or adventure movies. But calling it a family movie in quotes means that a) adults really can enjoy it as much as kids, if not more because of the little in-jokes and silly vulgarities, and b) once a kid sees it, when he revisits it, as I have a few times, it's still as fresh but with some things not quite understood the first time around. It's a comedy that is not only filled with jokes at Robin Hood movies and other movies (Godfather of course, as well as little mentions for other movies of modern times), but one that references Brooks's own movies as well; this is a filmmaker who isn't above poking fun at even his own style.Basic story- Robin Hood (Cary Elwes in one of his best turns) returns home from the crusades to see things are in peril with King Richard gone, and so goes forth to reclaim his land and to, naturally, rob the rich to feed the poor. Along the way he meets Achoo (Dave Chappelle), butts heads with Prince John (Richard Lewis) and the Sheriff, and of course still pines for the love of Maid Marian. This, of course, is the usual clothesline for Brooks to let the comedy run off into the scenes, and while sometimes a joke may not work or might become stale on a repeat viewing, so much of it sticks that it's hard not to chuckle. It also helps that a couple of bits are some of the best in any Brooksfilm, such as the Godfather bit (Dom DeLouise at his very best), Brooks's own cameo as the Rabbbi, Lewis and Chappelle's acting turns, and an endless slew of quotable lines and a couple of tongue-in-cheek songs. Some of it is obvious, yes, some of it just takes right from the pages of Blazing Saddles, sure, but is it a good time for the right crowd? Definitely- and for parents who grew up on the 70's Brooks work, it is a fantastic way to introduce the young ones to his work through this (even the suggestive sex jokes and such are not R-rated, all in good fun).",disgust

"Talk about the wrong message for women of the 21st century - this is it! Here's Meg Ryan playing a very successful business woman. Maybe she's not had great success in past relationships, but hey! there are plenty of non-successful women in the same boat. At least she has a life - she knows what she wants and goes for it. AND she doesn't give in to the sexual harassment her boss attempts to guarantee her the promotion she wants so dearly.So, she gets the promotion - head of the New York office! And what does she do? She throws it away in a heart-beat to go live in the 19th century with a guy she's known for a week, and spent one evening and Saturday with. Yeah, that's a great place for a go-getter business woman! They'll be sure to welcome her with open arms in the business world of the 1800s. After the starry-eyed infatuation wears off, I'd hate to see the life these two manage to carve out!Message: finding a man is way more important than any success a woman may find in business. A woman's place is with her man no matter what she has to give up for him. YUK!! Give me Legally Blonde over this movie any day! Altho Reese Witherspoon started out thinking her life revolved around some guy, she came to realize that who she was mattered much more than what (she thought) he wanted her to be. Much better message - in order to be happy, find yourself, then the right man will come along.Now besides this (as if this yucko message to women wasn't bad enough!) there was one major flaw which kept me distracted the whole movie. Here's this inventor from the 1800's (he supposedly invented the elevator) suddenly thrust into the 21st century. Does he show even the slightest curiosity about all the innovations from the past 100+ years? The only item he seemed interested in was the toilet. Guess they thought they should go for the lowest humor possible on this movie. Why wasn't he interested in the television, telephone, answering machine, cars, computers, etc. His main concern was with being polite. How shallow can a guy be? I can't begin to see what Meg Ryan saw in him.I give this movie a huge thumbs down.",disgust

It lost it's direction, the writing became painfully contrived and to be honest the Revenge aspect of the show got lost behind several relationships... sad to say it quickly became a bla bla bla show fit only for teenage girls!i abandoned this one after 14 episodes, it would have been 8 or 9 if not for my wife... now even she can't be bothered with it!!

""Get a life!"" is the best advice for those critics.

Recommended as an alternate choice for those who have laughed and cried through two dozen other romantic comedies with mild suspense.",disgust

"I think someone found the right word to describe this film earlier: inoffensive. Even Eastern European dictators might find it hard to find much to complain about. Indeed, so lame is this film I was amazed to learn it was intended for a cinema release, although in my part of Slovetzia it seems to have gone straight to video. Actually, this is a pretty harmless way of spending an hour and a bit if you can accept that this is basically a vehicle for Fran Dreschler, and that, presumably, she has some fans in America who both like her and know who she is.Dreschler plays a beautician who gets mistaken for the new tutor of an eastern European dictator and ends up importing consumerism and the American way of life by stealth to the previously contented communist kingdom of Slovetzia. I say ""communist kingdom"" because on the strength of this film some Americans don't seem to know the difference between the two. For those of you unfamiliar with Slovetzia, when Errol Flynn was alive it used to be called Ruritania, but later changed its name under communism. These days it is populated entirely by British actors, some of whom attempt mildly Russian accents. You may be as surprised as I was to learn that the tyrannical ruler of Slovetzia is none other than Timothy Dalton. You may remember him from the 1980s when he used to be James Bond. At one point he was even well regarded as a serious Shakespearian actor. What happened to him after leaving the secret service, you might ask? Well, I don't really know, but it can't have been pretty. Somehow he ended up playing second fiddle to Fran Dreschler. I know, a sad end for a man who saved the world at least twice.",disgust

"We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.Paid critics are wrong again! This is one of the funniest Adam Sandler movie and not only is it funny but it will be loved by the Gay community and it has a very important point for the Republicans. We loved it. Kevin James, Jessica Biel, and everyone of Adam's buddies give an outstanding performance.To hell with the critics, what do they want? This is not one of those silly dumb movies (that we like anyway), but it has a wonderful point in it's plot. If you love any of these people you will love it.So go out and have a great time. Again we loved it and recommend it highly.",disgust

Michael is a rude, obnoxious, womanizing messenger of heaven who will fulfill your wishes, and make you care enough about the world that you will be touched.Funny, but not greatly so, touching but not overly sentimental, intelligent without being clever...it is just a good simple, small comedy.

"This latest independent, low-budget mind-trip has lofty ideals, but without a single driving force to make them worth anything. Branded is set in a world very much like our own, a world ruled by brands and the companies who market them. To assume that this film is further from the truth than it is closer would be ignorant, in my own humble opinion. So, we've established that the world is our own. Enter the main characters, a man and woman, in love, who see the world for what it is and take advantage of it until the world chews them up and spits them out. Up until this point in the film, the storytelling lacks anything that compels us to root for any of the characters, and presents us with weird scenes, flashbacks, and a monotone narration that seems out of place, at best. Once our male hero is banished and is enlightened in the middle of a field by a star cow in the sky that tells him to perform an ancient sacrificial ritual (yeah, that's right), he heads back to find his girl and change the world. While we're never led to believe that he didn't know how the world works, his new-found enlightenment has now allowed him to literally see how marketing is urging and pulling us this way and that, as he is the sole witness to a world where people are controlled by monstrous personifications of marketing which grow from their backs (yeah, that's right). It's this last act that finally goes somewhere and gives us reason to root for our heroes, and yet I felt it was more unnecessary than the rest of the film. The creation of these marketing ""monsters"" seems nothing more than a cool pipe-dream designed to show us what our world is doing to us. But it's never explained! Why, I ask! Where do they come from? What do they want? Who is the sky cow? I can suspend my disbelief for a film that rewards me for it, that takes me to a world that makes sense in spite of its oddities. This one just let me down, and would have served its message better if it took time to set a few things straight or simply play it straight, with no sky cow. I dunno, maybe I'm just no fun.-Thomas Bond, TheFilmDiscussion.com",disgust

We have the re-animated women, the nut case, high on adrenaline, The mad doctor, the specialist in disguises, the women whose patronage seems really out of place. There are virtually no motivations for anything--it just rambles on from one scene to the next. The little instructional breaks explaining various psychological anomalies lead us into--what? It's as if it's supposed to be a clinical film and then you have this ranting. The cat gets its eye popped out. There are Poe things, ""The Black Cat,"" with the walled up person. I don't know.

"Bob Rafelson is a puzzling director. After his big successes with ""Fiver Easy Pieces"" and ""The King of Marvin Gardens"", Mr. Rafelson doesn't seem to come out with a film project that will take him back to his past glory. This is evident with the disastrous ""Man Trouble"" shown on cable recently.The film is a mess. Jack Nicholson, an actor who has worked with the director before with better results, plays the main role of Harry Bliss a trainer of dogs without any redeeming qualities. Harry is married to an Oriental woman and is working his marital problems with a counselor. Harry gets involved with Ellen Barkin, who is being stalked. The solution is to get a German Shephard dog to protect her. She has moved to her sister's swanky home where probably the only funny scene happens. We watch Ms. Barkin working with the dog and all her commands have to be in German, otherwise the dog doesn't respond! The others in the cast are totally wasted. Beverly D'Angelo has some good moments. Michael McKean, Saul Rubineck, Henry Dean Stanton, are seen in supporting roles.See if there is something else to watch, but don't make the same mistake we made.",disgust

So, needless to say, I didn't expect much.I was pleasantly surprised and amused by its portrayal of a boring, redneck small Texas town (like where I presently live) and its hick residents, and the typical bored teenage boys and the trouble they get into, just like I used to (well, not QUITE like I used to!)Like many other reviewers, I'm very surprised that Christina Naify hasn't appeared in many other films, because I felt that she was the best player in the cast.  I also loved Wilson Cruz, as a scared, whiney, (and cute!) Gay boy, and really got off seeing him kick the crap out of a redneck from school.  The concept of Adam West playing the part of a pimp was quite entertaining too.The plot was a bit twisted, with several unexpected turns that kept me guessing what would happen next.  Unlike some other reviewers, I'm not bothered by slight inconsistencies and/or loose ends, I mean, come on, I paid a buck (for all three of us to watch it), and we got an hour and a half of decent entertainment!All-in-all, I give it 2.5 stars on the Leonard Maltin scale.

"This is a pretty cute coming-of-age flick which has been languishing in distributor purgatory for more than a year. An indy filmed in late 1999, it was hoped to be a summer youth comedy, ala American Pie, but it never managed to work out a US distribution deal, and it may still not have one. They are now talking on the official web site about releasing it in the summer of 2001 in the USA, even though it has already been playing for some months across the world. They have some hot young names in the cast: Jaime Pressly (the major babe of ""Poison Ivy 3""), Marissa Ribisi (""Grown Ups""; she's Giovanni's twin sister), Katherine Heigl (""Roswell"")And I like the concept. Matt is a college freshman, a virgin, a bright and sensitive kid but basically a dweeb. Early in the year he is trapped in an elevator with a girl during a blackout, they have a tremendous heartfelt discussion, they make love, but he never sees her face. When he wakes up, she's gone without a trace. Ignoring the fact that she would have left a note if she wanted to see him again, Matt knows that he's found his true love, and will have to find her. All he knows is that she resides in a certain dorm with 100 residents, so he has to concoct a series of ploys in order to gain admittance to the   building and the trust of the girls. One of the girls becomes his accomplice, and between them they come up with two different plans. Sometimes Matt is the uniformed maintenance man who will take care of the girls dorm. Sometimes he's in drag as a woman.In the course of the semester, he really learns a lot about women while searching for his honey. He learns so much that after his speech to 100 open windows, begging his secret lover to reveal her identity, she does not, but all the other hetero girls claim they were the one! He can basically have any of them, and he's come to like many of them during the year, but he's a romantic and an honorable man, so he continues his search for his true love.
Other salient points:There isn't much flesh, but there is plenty of really dirty talk. Dora, the intellectual girl, likes to read Henry Miller and D.H, Lawrence out loud, for example, and the taboo ""c"" word appears in the reading, along with some very lustful situations! When the girls are completely at ease, when they are drunk and Matt is in drag, they tell some hilarious stories to each other. One night each of them shares her funniest      stories about oral sex. I suppose there is a real risk of NC-17 in the USA, for the language, and for the fact that one of the girls is openly promiscuous, seduces Matt, and obviously is really into it, both with her speech and her hips. It was some darned good lovin', not movie sex at all, but real people getting used to each other and having problems, then working it out.Matt's own roommate is a doofy misogynist who is into ""penis power"", a system in which he gradually ties larger and larger weights to his penis, to lengthen and strengthen it. And of course, there is the requisite evil dude who exploits women.Believe it or not, it is an intelligent movie. Possibly too intelligent for this genre. In fact, the dialogue is probably too intelligent    for this or any other genre. The characters actually talk in written English rather than spoken English, the kind of poetic rhapsodies that nobody is capable of in real life, not JFK or Churchill or anybody else. Matt's speech to the 100 open windows is the spiritual descendant of Kevin Costner's famous speech in Bull Durham, too articulate to really be off the cuff, and it has the same impact on all 100 girls that Costner's words had on Sarandon.
But I don't think we need to consider that a weakness. Let's just say that the movie walks a fine line between literate and literary, and sometimes it may cross over the line a bit too far, but you'll allow it because it isn't boring and it produces the desired effect. Hope they get a US distributor, and I hope they can get an r-rating, because I think a lot of young people will like this funny and sincere film. I won't tell you it's a great work of genius, and I won't say it's a sure hit, but I think it deserves a chance to let the popular jury make that call. It has a strong pro-female stance in that it portrays women as the only real grown-ups in the world, and Matt's experience in drag really sensitizes him to how much abuse women have to tolerate, so it could reach out to a female audience, assuming the rough talk is OK with them.Young guys should like it, and learn from it. Some of them will buy a ticket just to see Katherine Heigl playing enthusiastic foosball in her bra. And I predict they won't demand a refund.",disgust
"Stupid, contrived story of a hulking angel (Travolta) who comes to earth, investigated by a reporter (Hurt) and an ""angel expert"" (McDowell). Writer/Director Nora Ephron has created one of the lamest, moost vacuous stories this side of ""Ghost"".  If yer lookin' for hokey cornball fluff, this is yer moovie.  ""Michael"" is talky, dull, and even manages to ruin the many cliches it employs to chog through it's 100+ minutes.  For example, never has the MooCow seen the cliche'd Hollywood ""Bar Fight"" plot device  moore clumsily, contrived, and unbelievably executed.  Travolta is about as animate as a stuffed Ken doll, and adds a loathsome, churlish aspect to his paltry, two-dimensional character.  Ephron seems to specialize in fluff, either writing, directing, or both, in such moovies as ""Sleepless in Seattle"", ""When Harry Met Sally"", and ""Heartburn"", with very uneven results. I guess the idea that an angel smokes and wanders around in boxer shorts is supposed to be funny and irreverent, but it comes off as just sophmoric. Watch Christpher Walken in ""The Prophecy"" to really see the angel cliche spun on its head.  This is the sort of drivel that gives ""chick-films"" a very bad (and in this case, well-deserved)name.  The MooCow says this ""Michael"" is a muddle.  :=8P",disgust

"This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only lacks any acting skill, but the script is incredibly shallow and lame. You actually hear serious dialogue that goes, ""I love you more."" ""No, I love YOU more."" I stopped watching the movie (online) after the first half hour, I couldn't take it anymore. Her ""southern girl charm"" just doesn't work and is really quite annoying; her attempts at slapstick humor fall flat and she delivers lines like she is reading the script right off the page.Poor Luke Wilson. Did he not read the script before agreeing to do this, or did he fall for Papa Joe's (Jessica's dad and also the producer of the movie) promise of big profits? Hopefully he now knows better than to sign on to another movie like this. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - I hate seeing the pained look on his face as he suffers through the bad dialogue.Also, I think the previous commenter giving this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably either involved in the movie somehow or hired by Papa Joe to give the movie a better rating. No one in their right mind would actually find this movie engaging.Jessica has lots of money, right? Maybe buy some acting lessons?",disgust

"Yes - Payback & Point Blank (1967) are very similar. But there is a very good reason for that. Both films are based on the novel 'The Hunter' by Richard Stark, a pseudonym for Donald E Westlake.The films share several character names such as Brewster, Carter, Stegman and Fairfax and similar plots. In both cases the anti-hero Porter (or Walker) is trying to recover a sum of money after being double-crossed.Now, I am a huge fan of Point Blank. It takes a relatively simple plot and makes a bit of cinematic poetry out of it. And if I was forced to compare Lee Marvin and Mel Gibson's performances, then I'm sorry but Gibson would lose big time. However, Payback is a much better film than I thought it would be. There are sufficient differences to make the story interesting and though it is told in a much more straightforward and, dare I say, 'safe' way than Point Blank, it is a very well made film and tells a compelling story well. And it's nice to see Gibson return to a somewhat morally ambiguous character a la Mad Max.",disgust

"Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) meets Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) at a bar, they get drunk and have a little fun afterward, then they part ways. That is, until a few weeks later, Alison discovers she's pregnant and Ben is the father. This simple story makes up the hilarious film Knocked Up. I really enjoyed this, it has a lot of great laughs and it also has a lot of heart spread throughout.Seth Rogen does an excellent job, I'm glad he's been given the chance to be the lead in such a big film. And Katherine Heigl is equally entertaining. The two of them are so great together, they're just so much fun to watch on screen. The supporting actors are also wonderful. Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd are perfect together. And I think Kristen Wiig steals the show with her small yet hysterical role as one of the workers at E!.When people go to see this they'll want to compare it with 40 Year Old Virgin. Though I'm not a big fan of comparing movies to other movies, I guess I'll have to go through with it. For me, 40 Year Old Virgin is a funnier movie, but Knocked Up is a better written film and it has more heart to it. Both films based their story on a simple premise (a nerdy 40 year old hasn't had sex, a guy has a one night stand and gets the woman pregnant), but it seems like 40 Year Old Virgin used its idea to just get laughs. Knocked Up, on the other hand, uses its set up and continues the story throughout the film, developing its characters.So, Knocked Up is a very enjoyable film, it has some big laughs (I particularly love the side story with the bearded roommate) but its also very sweet at times. I'm sure people will love it. See the movie and you'll get more than just laughs.",disgust

"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)Not that there is a TV version.We could also call this 'Madonna on top' or 'Madonna in charge' or maybe 'She can show you the power you can have from the prone position.' The one thing about Madonna, other than having no shame (and I admire her for that) is that she can crawl and not feel the slightest bit reduced.She's not especially bad in this mediocre thriller, nor especially good. The script is ridiculous and the treatment without a hint of nuance or subtlety. William Dafoe and Joe Mantegna seemed to be acting on rote and Anne Archer was a wash. The problem is the movie is so obviously fake that it's like watching bad TV. There's no point other than kinky sex. I'm not sure why Madonna agreed to do this. I can't believe she needed the money, nor can I believe she didn't care about her reputation as a performing artist. I think her appearance here exposes her weakness: simply put, she has bad taste because this could not in any way further her career.On the plus side I saw the unrated version and she was very sexy.",disgust

"SHOCK! HORROR! A barrage of hostile comments bashing Simpson & making Papa Joe out to be the Saddam Hussein of the movie world! WOW! WHAT A SHOCK! (Yes that is HEAVY sarcasm). And how many of these morons will have bothered to watch the movie before posting those comments? I'm guessing none but they see ""Jessica Simpson"" and they can't resist. It's quite pathetic really.So onto a review of the actual film from somebody who HAS bothered to watch it then? It's pretty much what you go in looking for - a cute, fluffy & fun movie which showcases Jessica Simpson as a lovable goof ball and breaks no new ground but happens to have just enough funny moments & cute performances to save its self. It's the sort of movie to rent on a Friday night in, the sort of thing that you don't have to think too hard about but don't find yourself falling asleep during & will leave you with a little smirk thanks to it's star and it's sappy ending.This movie is and always has been a Jessica Simpson vehicle which is made pretty damn clear from the outset. From it's title to it's setting to it's cameos from her dog, her father & her hairstylist to it's unoffensive and quirky heroine. Her first movie role takes her public persona and throws in just enough acting material for her to practise with until she gets cast as lead in a big movie, it's the people who haven't figured that out that are having the problem here. Given that she's the lead makes it obvious to everyone that she's gonna have to showcase a little more than in her prior roles. Does she have the acting talent that she's constantly belittled for? Well yes. If you actually watch the movie you'll see that Simpson does have the making of a comedic actress - which is handy because she doesn't seem to be trying anything else. She has the right amount of on screen charm & charisma to draw you in and enough quirks to keep you giggling up until the ending (which you WILL see coming - but why is that always a bad thing?). Her deliverance is just fine and she brings the character to life - anybody who has a hard time believing her here i can't quite understand as she doesn't do anything wrong. Quite the opposite - it's her quirky little faces, the winks, the smiles & the giggles that make Katie Gregorstich a person - and which Amy Renfo in EOTM lacked.As for her co-stars - Luke Wilson, Rachael Leigh Cook, Drew Fuller, Penelope Ann Miller, Andy Dick, Larry Miller & Willy Nelson are there for Jessica's character to bounce off of and they're charming and funny but to be fair to them, aren't really given much to play with as it's made clear from the outset that they are all just supporting character. Penelope Miller is the most impressive of the costars as she shapes & molds the hapless & unwitting Katie, Drew Fuller is all too convincingly shallow & Luke Wilson does well as the love interest with a secret.The script is a little weak and it's not exactly ground breaking but it's actors keep it alive and it offers enough material to keep them happy. The direction is fine - not great but good enough to keep you interested.The movie does have a sort of cheap feel to it but i imagine the salary bill took up over half of the budget & it only really shows in the taxi scene & the horrid shots of Katie on the street in New York which are badly lit, badly wigged & totally unnecessary.So to sum up, what is this movie? Plainly put it's a Jessica Simpson comedy veichle. That said - Is it groundbreakingly, earth shatteringly, hart wrenchingly amazing? No, is it cute, funny & good enough to rent? Definitely. Should i believe all the a-holes who are on one constant bash? No. Should i watch it? YES!!",disgust

"I went into the theater not knowing what to expect, not having seen the trailer, and two hours later I felt I had seen a decent movie, quite funny at times, but I couldn't figure out what everyone was making such a big deal about. Compared to a lot of what passes for comedy in the cinema these days, Knocked Up is great, but it's hardly the ""instant classic"" that I've seen it called in many professional and IMDb reviews. It's certainly worth seeing, but maybe at a discount matinée instead of a full-price evening show.Much of what is wrong with Knocked Up is simply an over-reliance on Seth Rogen to deliver the laughs. To be sure, Rogen is a funny guy - he handled the jump from second-tier supporting actor (a la 40 Year Old Virgin) to leading man surprisingly well, appearing confident and charismatic. The problem is that as the film goes on, he just doesn't get a whole lot to work with from his supporting cast. Rogen doesn't have enough in him at this point to carry an entire film on his shoulders, but often he is forced into that role, providing the only humor in many scenes (especially in the second half of the movie). At times it almost seems as if Rogen has landed in the wrong film, delivering clever quips and laughs while the barely-likable characters around him remain too serious. Paul Rudd manages to break this up, taking some of the burden off Rogen, but Katherine Heigl and Leslie Mann's unfunny and quasi-sympathetic characters drag them down.To be sure, the first half of Knocked Up is great, but by the second half the script becomes mired in slow, cliché drama. Marital dissatisfaction and the loss of youth are interesting themes to explore, but in doing so, Knocked Up fails to establish a consistent tone. As the film trudges past the 90-minute mark, it is sometimes humorous, sometimes dour, often clichéd, all resulting in an awkward mix of styles.Overall, Knocked Up was a good effort, but a little more editing of the script would have helped a lot. I don't mind long movies at all, but 20 minutes could have been trimmed from this film to good effect.",disgust

I liked Rita (Kate Winslet) the best, but that's if I had to choose one character. Roddy (Hugh Jackman) was the star though. The little slugs singing on the side are cute in their own way too.

To me it seems like he is going for a Hayden Christensen sorta thing. Most of the other characters in this film are bleak to say the most. They just kinda come and go with out any attachment, well from the viewers perspective at least. Anne Heche is super hot in this movie. I could never really feel for her though in this movie. I guess it was just the way she reacted to the situations at hand. I did love the pothead roommate though! It was hilarious hearing her cough in the distance. And the fact that she never came out of her room, I can relate with that. Well I liked this movie and it actually got better throughout the movie.

"In this raunchy thriller, Madonna is suspected of murdering her elderly partner using her sexy body (lucky guy).

It is true that Madonna and her body are the main reason to watch this thriller but there are some decent genuine performances by defoe and mantegna battling it out in the court room and Anne Archer as the deceased' embittered ex. Julianne Moore is also in there in a small role as Franks (defoes) wife.Bottom line! if you like 80/90s sex films then this is a definitely worth watching.

"I love Ellen Barkin, 'deed I do, but even she cannot make the romance with Jack Nicholson believable here. Even back in 1992, Nicholson was TOO OLD to play a romantic lead with a woman seventeen years his junior.I was getting the creeps watching this in the fall of 2008, and suddenly I realized why. The pairing reminds me of John McCain and his trophy wife, Cindy. McCain: born 1936. Nicholson: born 1937. Cindy and Barkin: both born 1954.It's obnoxious, the way Hollywood continues to indulge Nicholson (and, presumably, equally elderly male producers and writers) with this assumption that an audience can believe gorgeous young women will fall all over him. Oh, spare me. And start giving actresses Nicholson's own age parts like the plums HE gets, or at least, parts playing his love interest.I like dogs, I like Ellen Barkin, and that's why I was able to endure the movie at all, though I was embarrassed for her being stuck with such a ludicrous part - and one which, in a movie meant to be funny, failed to take full advantage of her talent for comedy, especially her considerable physical comedy chops.Also loved Lauren Tom as the Nicholson's wife! Again, the age difference is severe - Tom was born in 1961, making her fully 24 years younger than Nicholson and his character - but Tom's put-on accent (she was born in Chicago) and Nicholson's overall sleaziness suggest that she's a mail-order bride struggling to make the best of a groom who calls her ""Iwo Jima."" Tom, like Barkin, deserves better writing than this.One star for Barkin, one star for Tom, and one star for the dog. Zero stars for the rest of it, particularly casting Nicholson and for the overly-complex plot lines.",disgust

"New York heiress Holly Gooding (Drew Barrymore) kills a relative who's looking to push her out of the family fortune. Or is it an evil doppelganger?

Elizabeth (Leslie Hope) is his writing partner. Doctor Heller has been treating Holly in New York. It's a silly little horror. The only point is to wait for the final reveal of whichever way the story wants to use as an explanation. It's not really a mystery. The movie has a few possible ways to go and the audience is simply left waiting for it to decide. The jump scares don't work. The music cues are extremely heavy. There are some bad camp here.

"I understand to a point why people desire the revival of the slasher flick. In the 70's you had Halloween. In the 80s you had Friday the 13th and Elm Street. In the 90's you had I Know What You Did Last Summer and the Scream franchise. The fact is these are Classics that cannot be touched which is why most got remade. The girl in the photographs does not try to be those films which perhaps is why some were disappointed. I thought the movie was filmed well and the cast was good with the exception of the leading lady. Watching her was like watching Kristen Stewart in the first Twilight movie. She was one note, monotone and forgettable which is really unacceptable seeing as how our villain becomes obsessed with her when there wasn't anything to be obsessed about. She was lacking personality extremely. She mostly just came off as a bitch reminiscent of the stone-faced actress that acted opposite Channing Tatum in Magic Mike. Having said that there were some problems with the script. There's absolutely no character development for our leading lady and absolutely no character development for our villains either. You get the impression that they're brothers but that's never said. There's nothing to make you give a crap about the ""star"". Does she have parents? Was she hatched from an egg? Did she grow up in this town or just move there? All we know is she has an ex boyfriend that she doesn't want to talk to for a reason that's never said and she works in the grocery store. It's pretty easy not to care about most of the characters since most of them are shallow which is fine it's always nice to see dumb shallow pretty people get killed off in horror movies. The truth is the real star of this film is The Mastermind villain. His performance reminded me of the young villain in the first Purge movie. He was very strange and perfectly creepy like a stalker should be. I love that I couldn't tell what he was going to do next and that he was enjoying it. All and all I think the villains were pretty perfect aside from their lack of backstory. Other holes in the plot include if it's such a small town how does no one notice these people missing? How long have these guys been doing this? Why are the cops such idiots? I love discovering good new villains. That's what makes this movie worth a sit-down. I thought the masks were creative. The kills not so much but man just a little bit more story and some recasting and the film would have been a lot better. But I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not an in-your-face slasher flick where loud orchestrated music plays as the villain jumps out very Scream style. It's more along the lines of Kiss the Girls just not as good but we can't all be James Patterson.",disgust

"I think it is common knowledge by now that the 80s were being plagued by a flood of all kinds of sci-fi movies in order to exploit the tremendous success of the 70s ""Star Wars"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". We also don't have to discuss the fact that a majority of these movies was complete and utter rubbish, to be perfectly frank. But with ""Space Mutiny"", we don't just have a movie that is just a cheap rip-off of Star Wars. Oh, don't get me wrong, it certainly is at heart, but this movie actually accomplishes the herculean task of representing the absolute, sad bottom of the barrel of the 80s sci-fi shlock. No, ""Space Mutiny"" is not just ""Solarbabies""-bad. We're talking about a movie that is ""Robot Holocaust""-bad, and if that does not scare you away already, then you are tougher than the casual movie-goer.With a movie this dreadful, it is difficult to decide where to begin with mentioning the various glaring faults this cinematic abomination tortured us with, but I think the no. 1 reason for this movie to suck so bad is the non-existent budget. At least I was unable to realize that this movie even had a budget higher than 1000$ during most of the scenes, and that's the death twitch for this flick. The story is supposed to take place in the far future, on a self-sustaining, gigantic space ship called ""Southern Sun"", carrying hundreds of people on a mission to colonize new worlds. Unfortunately, the sets and art design are unable to establish this premise at all. In fact, the inside shots of the space ship sometimes even give away the fact that some scenes were being filmed inside a warehouse, with the sun shining through the windows being visible in the background, and no effort to hide this embarrassing goof at all. Or take the futuristic vehicles, for example. Well, there actually is only one kind of vehicle on board of the Southern Sun: a golf cart. Yes, that's right. A golf cart. As if that wasn't bad enough already, it's getting worse when we are forced to watch an exciting chase sequence involving two golf carts...yuck, yuck, yuck. 90% of all the other action sequences revolve around shoot-outs between our ""bold"" heroes and the fiendish villains, with fake and cheesy laser beams having been edited into the picture afterwards, and needless to say, it looks laughably bad. And I am still at a loss of words in view of the fact that the footage of the Southern Sun and the unnecessary space battles has been taken directly from Battlestar Galactica (what does that tell you about the quality of the flick if the creators had to steal from Battlestar Galactica? Sad...), with no mentioning of the original source and with no permission by the creators of BG. That kinda tells us how much money was being spent on the special effects, alright, and as a result, we sometimes don't see certain events like a small shuttle landing in the hangar bay of the Southern Sun. Instead, we just see ridiculously cheap vector graphics on a computer monitor straight from the beginning of the 80s, with a voice over telling us what these animated lines and objects are supposed to represent. A similar sequence in the first Star Wars (the briefing shortly before the attack on the Death Star) was lightyears ahead of this crap, and even an Atari 2600 would have been ashamed of these computer graphics. Yep, this movie takes us into the far future, and that alone makes me buy this fact completely...just like the 80s disco onboard...Okay, the ""action"" and ""special effects"" (I hate to mention these terms in the same line as this flick...) are among the worst the 80s have to offer, and unfortunately, there is no story to save this movie from falling apart. I won't even bother to go deeper into the countless plot holes this flick has to offer for critics (involving one unbelievably embarrassing continuity error within just 3 minutes...), but at least the actors deserve an ""honorable"" mention. If ""Robot Holocaust"" was the epitome of lifeless acting, then ""Space Mutiny"" is the perfect example for horrible overacting. Each and every single character over-emphasizes his or her lines to an extent that it becomes unbearable to listen to them, even though this certainly was an attempt to make the inane dialogue seem less stupid than it is. Especially the villain named Kalgon (responsible for the mutiny mentioned in the title) and the hero David Ryder are the lowlights in this regard, with Kalgon's overacted and clichéd villain lines and idiotic eeeeevvvvvviiiiilllll laughter being the icing on the cake. And don't get me even started on the chemistry between the characters, since I sure as hell did not notice any chemistry whatsoever, no-thanks to some horrible casting decisions (whoever chose Cisse Cameron as the female lead character and youthful *cough* lead should not be allowed to be in film business anymore).The only way to watch this joke of a sci-fi film without suffering severe pain is to choose the MST3K version. Mike and the bots even make this dung to a hilarious experience, and their witty (and true) comments are a far better way to sum up the idiocy of this movie than any review possibly could. But since this is a review of the movie and not the MST3K version, there's no way this movie deserves anything above 1/10. Right on par with the worst the 80s have to offer.",disgust

"I'm going to preface this by saying that I went in expecting a funny movie. That being said, I was very disappointed. There were maybe 3 or 4 laughs, most of which were provided by the side characters. The rest of the movie consisted of the two main characters arguing and trying to do horrible things to each other. Additionally, the characters couldn't have been more stereotypical. Vince Vaughn played the typical sports and video game obsessed nincompoop that gives the male gender a bad name. Jennifer Aniston was the standard ""you don't appreciate me"" female lead whose sole purpose it seemed was to whine about trivial nonsense.

"i like this movie mostly for one reason. that reason is because of the way it turns on it's head the normal way in which a character is made into a badass. generally speaking i've noticed in movies that a character can be built up as a badass in a number of ways. most of these include either not showing the character at all (The Usual Suspects, Boba Fett, Hannibal in Silence of The Lambs) or showing them in light that doesn't particularly lend itself to inspiring badass-ness (Clint eastwood in Unforgiven) or minimizing the character's screen bad ass time (Darth Vader, terminator 1,) meanwhile other characters in the periphery will expound on the alleged badness of the character... this is a great strategy for making a character quite memorable. anthony perkin's psycho is still considered a bad dude because so little is known about him until the end. and this technique of leaving it up to the viewer's imagination works well for other things too, such as implied violence, in reservoir dogs, and implied intelligence (any morgan freeman character)but here in Payback mel Gibson just does exactly the opposite, the movie acts as a kind of two hour buildup of the his character's factor of badass-ness, with little plot, or development, or nuance along the way. meanwhile instead of verbally building himself up on screen ala Keyser Soze, the character instead undercuts his character's bad ass-ness by slyly poking fun at himself, and allowing a bit of abuse to come his way. By the end of the film the Mel Gibson has established a classic movie badass.it works!8 out of 10",disgust

"Hugh Jackman is everywhere these days, from reprising his iconic Wolverine role in summer blockbuster X3, to starring twice alongside Scarlett Johansson in Woody Allen's Scoop and Christopher Nolan's The Prestige, and now, just lending his voice to a lead character in the animated film Flushed Away, co-starring his summer blockbuster star Sir Ian McKellen. Soon to come will be Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain. Whew! There seems to be no stopping this Hollywood flavour of the month!Despite this animated movie being yet another one of many based on talking animals, Flushed Away doesn't try too hard to be funny by steamrolling pop culture into the story. It just is funny with its deft touches, be it dialogue, slapstick, or various sight gags. Although it's set primarily in the sewers, it's beautiful chaos, with loads of little details all over that you'll probably need to watch it twice over to appreciate all the effort put in to create the computerized graphical sets.At first glance, you might think you're watching a Wallace and Gromit animated show. Yes, this is produced by the same studio, Aardman Animations, in association with Dreamworks, and it is no wonder that the animation, although computer generated, maintained a very clay like look and feel, as well as character designs bearing similar resemblance in style to W&G.The story is simple enough, yet adequately satisfying by the time the end credits roll. As the trailer suggested, Aristocratic rat pet Roddy from Kensington (Hugh Jackman) thought he just had the whole classy apartment to himself, when an unexpected guest Sid (Shane Richie) from the sewers gatecrashes into his abode, and ejects him through the ""jacuzzi"". All these in less than 10 minutes. So begins a mad journey in an unknown sewer world which replicated the modern London City above it with junk, where he has to figure out friend from foe, and find his way back to where he belongs.The themes of family and friends do not come on too strongly, instead the story preferred to let the character interactions bring forth the messages. Supporting or interfering in his quest are characters like Rita (Kate Winslet), The Toad (Ian McKellen), French Le Frog (Jean Reno), and rat minions Whitey (Bill Nighy) and Spike (Andy Serkis). It's quite commendable that in its less than 90 minutes runtime, it allowed for quite a bit of set action pieces to develop, along with almost laugh-a-minute lines of dialogue, a good mix of songs (Hugh sings!) and ooh, a diabolical plot.But what perhaps is the show stealer, are the sewer slugs. Ever popping up and performing at the right time, I'm sure they are crowd favourites despite their less than pleasant looking exterior. I wonder if they do sell the soft toy version, as it should be quite hilarious.If too many animated flicks left this year has left you jaded with the genre, Flushed Away just flushes away the competition.

"Kate & Leopold is more or less a romantic comedy that has been done so many times before. Woman and man see each other and don't like each other. Than they fall in love, but destiny comes in between them. In the end they overcome all problems and will live happily ever after...It's exactly the same as always, but this time they have added an interesting extra ingredient to it. Kate, her brother, her ex and Leopold all live in New York. The only problem is that Leopold is from the 1870's, while the others live in the 21st century. Kate's brother has found a way to travel through time, meets Leopold and accidentally takes him with him to the 21st century. I guess I don't have to explain everything that happens afterward...Even though I'm not always a huge fan of romantic comedies, I have to admit that I had a good time watching this one. Thanks to the original approach, this movie is better than average. The actors are convincing, although I was surprised to see how easily a man from the 19th century adapted to the 21st. It never really seemed a shocking experience to him. If I had directed the movie, I would have accentuated it more... But hey, if you can see past that and you are a romantic soul, I'm sure that you'll love this modern fairy tale. You know it's impossible, but you would like to believe it.

"Watching ""Space Mutiny"" is the metaphorical equivalent of drinking cat urine...there's no way it can be any good for you, so why even try?The special effects in this film are, I'm not kidding now, stock footage from Battlestar Galactica (played backwards, in some cases), or shot on what appears to be low-resolution video using models probably built from discarded ""He-Man"" toys.  Unfortunately, that's about the best thing in the movie.The acting...my God, the acting...I have NO idea who came up with this dialogue.  Reb Brown is ridiculous, John Philip Law is absolutely NOT to be believed, and the rest of the cast, as well as the costumes, look like outtakes from an episode of Buck Rogers!  (The second season...the really STINKY one!)  The whole damned thing looks vaguely like a fever dream I had as a child after drinking sixteen cans of ""Jolt""...and it's equally incomprehensible.  My God, they actually announce the arrival of a pirate fleet by having some dope on a microphone say, ""This is the pirate fleet...surrender or be turned into astro-dust.""  I think they shot the whole thing in a brewery with Go-Karts and used the same shot of a hops bin blowing up no less than four times. This movie has to be seen to be believed.

"I had heard for years that this was a great screwball comedy, perhaps a cut below ""It Happened One Night."" But this one piles one improbability upon another right at the outset. Powell is living in a dump -- for obscure reasons of his own -- but is selected as butler to the Bullocks. The problem, though, is that Lombard is given no part to play (Academy Award Nominee?). She's a brainless blonde whose only talent is to simulate crying fits. The sophisticated Powell would have nothing to do with her, except that the script says he must. Alice Brady is insufferable as the mother, a Billy Burke imitation, and a bad one at that. But Gail Patrick, biting, sardonic, beautiful, is great in this flick. Screwball comedies demand pace and plotting. This one has neither, and tries to add an ""important social message"" as well. Powell and Patrick would have been a good pairing in some film other that this one. Some films -- Chaplin, Keyton, for example -- are still funny today. Other films -- and this is an example -- make one wonder why people laughed way back then.",disgust

"Having seen almost every classic and influential crime drama of the past 30 years, I finally got around to seeing Heat. Having heard about how influential it has been in other movies and video games, I couldn't believe that I had waited so long to see this movie. Boy, was I disappointed. This movie is far from the masterpiece that I was led to believe. Other than a couple of great crime scenes (and a little bit of great action), I can't think of much that this film had that would make me want to see it again.While I wouldn't characterize the acting as bad, I can't think of anyone in this movie who gave a performance that is among their better ones. Al Pacino is practically a caricature of himself the entire time. He overacts in every scene and he yells about half of his lines. Robert Deniro has the same scowl on his face and speaks in pretty much the same voice for the whole movie. Pacino and Deniro fans looking for some ""tough guy"" porn will find plenty of it here.Ultimately, Heat is a movie that could have been made better by cutting about half the content. It is loaded with characters that are poorly developed, but are dramatically presented as if you are supposed to give a crap about any of them. One of them gets killed after about four minutes of screen time, and after that, we see his grieving wife. Rather than cry with her, I just kind of rolled my eyes. Another gang members death is presented with the drama akin to a squad mate getting killed in a war movie. I could have cared less. Val Kilmer's subplot centers around the tenuous relationship that he has with his wife. Al Pacino has a lousy third marriage and Robert Deniro somehow manages to have a romance side plot that is neither relevant nor believable.There is even a suicide attempt scene that has nothing whatsoever to do with the story – a diversion that will have you scratching your head, wondering why so much celluloid was wasted on it. Without exception, every single scene with a female in it could have been left on the cutting room floor, and not one shred of value would have been lost. None of the characters are sympathetic or well developed enough for you to want to see their romances work or to be able to share their pain. It would have worked well maybe in a television series where you would have more time to develop the characters, but here, all of the side plot material is really boring.One of the draws of this movie seems to be that it is a ""realistic"" and non ideal take on human behavior. Okay, I get that, but if you are going to go with the ""realistic"" approach, then don't ruin it with the occasional unbelievable scene or plot hole. The biggest offender is the famous bank robbery scene in the middle of the movie. It would have been spectacular in an action movie that didn't take itself seriously. But in Heat, I couldn't stop thinking about how absurd it was that a few guys with automatic weapons were able to cut through the entire LAPD like a hot knife through butter, escaping clean in the process. I still greatly enjoyed that scene, largely because it's just a great action scene that is well choreographed and shot. However, it's sort of out of place in this film.I'll give Heat some credit for not being a by-the-numbers cops and robbers movie. Maybe it is this uniqueness and the time of its release that made it so popular. Upon reflection though, there have been many crime and caper movies over the past few decades that are more entertaining than this one. Scarface, Reservoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects, to name but a few. While I didn't hate this movie, I certainly don't think that it deserves a place in the Top 10 greatest crime dramas.",disgust

ATM is about three co-workers (Eve, Peck and Geragthy) stop off at an ATM late one night and soon find themselves confined to an enclosed area made up of an ATM booth and car park by an unknown hooded killer lurking outside. There premise is good for a thriller but it's the execution which lacks thriller. Overall, ATM is trash-able, wait for Star movies or HBO to show you late at night.

I was way wrong. Half an hour into the movie my sides hurt from laughing, and by the end I couldn't stop smiling at not only the humour, but the surprising good moral taught by this movie. What begins as lame humour accompanied by nearly naked women, quickly turns into a heart-warming comedy about friendship and the definition of love.

This, of course, is a stretch, but since it is a comedy you just kind of go with it.So after James saves Sandler's life, Sandler agrees to go through with this. This is where the gay jokes ensue. Add in Ving Rhames who is a gay firefighter who comes out of the closet due to James and Sandler and also add in Jessica Biel as some eye candy who Sandler badly wants to date and you have all the ingredients of this comedy. Rob Schneider is funny playing an Asian minister. This movie is pro-gay I would say, so it shouldn't offend homosexuals, and Schneider is part Asian, so I guess he is supposed to be off the hook for making fun of that ethnic group. Anyway, all the jokes are supposed to be in good fun, but some people might get offended. If you are the type of person who gets offended easily, then you probably should avoid this movie.Some nice cameos in the film and the soundtrack is largely comprised of known gay artists.I saw this in the theater with my girlfriend. You would probably be smart to avoid the pricey theater tickets and wait until this comes out on DVD. This is not going to be a classic comedy and is not close to one of Sandler's best. At the same time, I don't think that it is an awful film either. Rating 6 0f 10 stars.",disgust

"It was only a matter of time that by 1993 Modonna one of the worlds most recognized woman and #1 sex symbol was to showcase her enormous and natural talents on the big screen for all to see.""Body of Evidence"" is a story about greed lust murder and betrayal where Madonna, Rebecca Carlson, is accused of murdering her rich and elderly lover with the most potent and deadly weapon at her disposal, her body. The lurid and sensational trial that followed left the quiet and sleepy little city of Portland Oregon so shook up that it still hasn't recovered from the shock that hit it after all these years. Portland Millionaire Andrew Marsh, Michael Forrest, is found dead of a heart attack in his mansion with his hands tied to the bed and a video tape of him and Rebecca Carlson having sex still playing on the VCR. Before long the DA has Miss. Carlson indited for his murder and the evidence against her is almost air-tight and a conviction seems like a forgone conclusion.Miss Carlson was to inherit $8,00,000.00 from Marsh after his death. Attorney Frank Dulaney, Willam Dafoe, takes the case for Carlson's defense and it turned out the be the biggest mistake that he ever made in his entire life.The movie goes from the ridiculous to the sublime and every thing else in between and by the time the movie is over you feel like you went over Niagara Falls on a surf board. You have to say one thing about ""Body of Evidence"" it's not at all boring and Madonna dose have acting talents with her very effective portrayal of the sexy and over the top Rebecca Carlson, even though she was obviously playing herself. Willam Defoe was very good as Rebecca's lawyer who was manipulated by her like all the men that she manipulated in the movie; you couldn't fault him for that once she turned it on the poor man was a goner. Anne Archer, Joanne Braslow, was tragic as well as sympathetic as Rebecca's rival for the dead millionaire Andrew Marsh's affections as well as money whom to no one's surprise lost out to. Joe Mantegna was as good as ever as the hard driving DA, Robert Garrett out to convict Rebecca for Marsh's murder. The movie has a number of shocking and explosive surprises that will keep you guessing until the final credits start to roll and is much better then you would expect from all the negative comments that it got at the time of it's release. Madonna's acting surprisingly evoking sympathy as well as outrage during the entire movie, Madonna was very good in the scene where she was on the witness stand, that even rival her scenes in the buff, which was the real reason for most people seeing the film, that gives the audience and extra bonus.",disgust

"I watched without prejudice & came out hating the film. There are more than 100 reasons, goofs & wrongs in this affectedly naive flick that I could/should write a book (about) and it might just go bestselling, due to the connection.Starting off with what we saw few years ago in Jab We Met, Shahrukh Khan tries very hard to impress his audience, spoofing his own films, songs, sequences (most notably that of DDLJ; it was funny, though) and meets his co-star, Deepika Padukone, who other than having a laughable South- Indian accent, does her part well. Khan imitates Jim Carrey in the first half, while he goes onto following his muscle memory of his yesteryear films. His character induces ridicule all through the 140 minutes of flashback screenplay. Supporting cast is fine but they are sidelined with not much dialogs given to them.And the dialogs given to the lead characters are either of their previous movies or of some other actors of other movies. Blast! Ridiculousness has no limits in the second half. From nerve-bending Antakshari to pun-centered jokes, from stupid drama to extremely atrocious points, the plot approaches climax and moves one step further to cross the highest level of predictability.Rohit Shetty has minimized his unbelievable stunts, but he has made it up with the level of spoofing, terrible humor & top-level horseplay. Awful cinematography accentuated with zero story sense & horrific plot advancements makes me wanna advice the whole crew not to underestimate the power of a common man's cinema interest. People depending upon Bollywood, thus need to find pleasure in International Film Festivals. I would prefer Ship Of Theseus, Calapor, BA Pass or even Sixteen over this, if I were you.The message at the end is truly unconventional but depicting it after such a long meaningless charade is a dumb idea. And the love-romance factor is gonna be the base of second, forth & eighteenth chapters if at all my book gets materialized.Lastly, music (read songs) comes to its rescue, although Rohit Shetty excels in directing the credit song video ""Lungi Dance."" The song is also catchy & one of the few parts of the film which forces me to rate it a hard-hearted 2.0/10!BOTTOM LINE: The end of Shahrukh Khan era is imminent. Rohit Shetty should stop, but I know he won't. Let him go paranoid in his own vomit! And for SRK fans, I suggest you to polish your Tamil before it is showcased on DTH. Not recommended! Overall, I laughed countably four times.Can be watched a typical Indian family?

"After an atrocious opening--Julia Roberts squabbling with boyfriend Brad Pitt over a balcony in a parking lot--""The Mexican"" improves, even comes up with some clever and funny bits of throwaway comedy. Although her performance is uneven, Roberts really shines in her scenes with gay hit-man James Gandolfini--so much so that when she's paired up again with Pitt, we miss her happy spark. Nearly all the scenes with the two main stars together are weak. The scattershot script tries combining too many different elements into its mix, leaving one character in particular (a charming one) shafted much too early. All this leads to 20 minutes of dead space in the final act that was simply torture to sit through. Might've been a wonderful black comedy, but the screenwriter didn't bother to take the viewer's feelings into consideration. ** from ****",disgust

The plot is intriguing enough to carry the film through and the romance between Costner and Houston builds steadily and realistically.With some decent action scenes, a decent cast and a great soundtrack, i found the Bodyguard to be an enjoyable movie.Clearly this film is not for everyone, it doesn't have enough action to satisfy the action fans, it isn't thrilling enough to be a thriller and as a pure romance film it is fairly weak; but i have to admit it does balance between these 3 genres quite well without excelling in any one of them.7/10",disgust

"This is a marvelous film and is a perfect example of light comedy from the 1930s. The writing and acting by the wonderful ensemble cast is absolutely dynamite and hard to beat. On top of that, it makes for great social commentary.William Powell plays Godfrey, a hobo brought home as part of a scavenger hunt. One of the girls in the family, ultra-dippy Carole Lombard, arranges for him to become their new butler and he is absolutely perfect at his job in every way and does a lot to get this rich but totally flighty family to function well, as when the movie starts it is like a madhouse instead of a family home. The zaniness going on is a lot of fun to watch, but you really have to feel for the father (Eugene Palette) having to put up with freeloaders like Mischa Auer, a stupid wife, one even stupider daughter and another who is a cold little thing. And, on top of everything else, the family is spending him into oblivion.Where the film goes I don't want to tell as it would ruin it. However, be prepared for some of the funniest characters and dialog you've seen in a long time.

"I love most Shah Rukh Khan movies. And I have enjoyed almost all the movies that Rohit Shetty has done. Deciding to watch Chennai Express first day first show was a no-brainer for me.Throughout the entire movie, I kept WANTING to like it. Shah Rukh Khan did try very hard and the effort showed on-screen, but somewhere the movie lost the connection with its audience. It is a movie that tries to celebrate itself without engaging the audience.I am all for this category of cinema. I loved the Dabang movies. I loved the Gol Maal movies (besides Gol Maal 2). I even enjoyed Om Shanti Om. I have no complaints against movies that don't have stories, as long as they are entertaining. I don't even have a problem with contrived jokes, as long as they make me laugh.Unfortunately, Chennai Express fails on several counts. Perhaps Rohit Shetty was so overawed by the fact that he was directing Shah Rukh Khan that he let it go. Or perhaps Shah Rukh Khan had so much faith in Rohit Shetty's brand of entertainment that he let it go.The music can at best be called above average. The songs really don't stay with you, and you expect much much better stuff from a Shah Rukh Khan movie.The end result is a movie that falls way short of expectations - at least mine. There are some good moments - especially between Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone - where they manage to make you laugh, but they are not enough to keep you entertained. Deepika Padukone actually puts in a good performance, especially compared to her previous roles. Shah Rukh Khan is extremely likable, but not likable enough for you to like Chennai Express.",disgust
"which is as much a commentary on the state of American cinema as it is on the quality of this surprising film.  Thoroughly enjoyable as long as you're not looking for One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  Deuce Bigalow provides a deft blend of juvenille humor and inventive verbal humor and situational gags.  I have to say that it has one of the funniest ""reconcilation"" scenes in a romantic comedy that I have seen in a long time.  But the great thing about this movie is that Rob Schneider has created a couple of really memorable and unique characters.  On top of that, there are many wonderful and touching moments hidden beneath the more obvious jokes and the many throwaway gags.",disgust

"Don't you just hate it when this happens? Now that you finally found yourself a gorgeous looking high school sweetheart, she turns out to be a murderous witch, capable of making you eat glass beer bottles with the touch of her hand! Damn! But Tamara has some very good reasons to be this cranky. The popular crowd at school tricked her into believing that the handsome and beloved English teacher has finally fallen for her, too, and set up a whole fake meeting in a sleazy hotel room. That's a pretty good reason to get rancorous already but, on top of that, they also accidentally killed her, buried her body in the woods and made a pact to keep it a secret. Thanks to several puberty years of casting spells, Tamara rises from the dead like a gorgeous babe with exclusively vengeance on her mind. First and foremost, I think it's hilarious how these movies portray the so-called ""unattractive"" girl. Tamara was never ugly to begin with, so simply combing her hair and wearing a push-up bra already turns her into a teenage sex bomb! ""Tamara"" isn't a very good horror film, mainly because it lacks originality and surprises. A big list of horror movies, which featured similar plots before, promptly comes to mind: There's ""Carrie"" (of course), but also ""The Craft"", ""I know What You Did Last Summer"" and even a bit of ""I Spit On Your Grave"". There's few to no tension in the script, although I do have to admit that the film actually was a lot gorier than I expected it to be. The playful deaths Tamara has in mind for her enemies are quite ingenious and close to being pure splatter. One poor sucker, for example, commits suicide live on school-TV whereas a girl pukes up gallons of blood. The acting performances are far above average, especially the females are good, and Jenna Dewan is definitely a promising talent to keep an eye on. Overall, this surely isn't a memorable new horror movie, but it never bores you and it's at least as good (if not better) than most big-budgeted Hollywood productions that receive theater-releases.",disgust

"Beautifully filmed, Madonna never looked better. This campy thriller gave Madonna fans some of her most famous lines--""Men Lie"", ""Have you ever seen animals make love"", That's what I do, I"", and a few others. Her clothes are incredible and Julianne Moore is very pretty too. Now, the problem lies not so much within Madonna's acting but timing...the film was released 3 months after her SEX book pictorial was released. The public just didn't know what to think, and I do think her constant blinking of the eyes can become very irritating. The sex scene in the parking garage is beautifully filmed and Madonna does kick some butt in the sex scene department. If you think about Sharon Stone's icy performance in Basic Instinct and Madonna's in this--they're really about the same. But a major Madonna backlash had begun by the time this film was released and was labeled a turkey. As a Madonna fan, I LOVE IT--as a regular viewer, ITS PRETTY GOOD. No, I can't lie-- I love it!

I do feel that 10-15 mins trimmed/cut off the runtime may have done this justice, as well as not having such a rushed and disappointing ending. I also would've rated this film higher if it had more substance and less filler. The directing was on point, as was the cinematography. The score and soundtrack was fitting. Casting was decent, with Thorne stealing the spotlight, and her character worked great with Manley. I was left wanting more, and I wish the writing had delivered that.

"I've noticed a lot of the negative comments about this title tend to focus on this movie's vulgar, 'stupid' humor. Now let's get one thing straight. Knocked Up is vulgar, absolutely it is, but is is not stupid. Stupid humor is crap like ""Mr. Woodcock"" and ""Good Luck Chuck,"" movies with no real craft to any of their jokes.""Jessica Alba fell down!!! Ahahahahahaha!"" ""He yelled 'sex' really loud!!! Pssshhahahahahaaheheheheeee!"" No. Die.Knocked Up, on the other hand, is actually pretty clever most of the time. And even the movie's vulgarity isn't done in an over-the-top, simply-for-gross-out way (cite the fat bitch from Good Luck Chuck). It's what I guess you could call 'relevant vulgarity.' Anyway, the movie is extremely funny. Every joke is naturalistic, but not expected. The movie's characters are all convincing and multi-dimensional, and above all likable. Seth Rogan really does make the movie, though. He is hilarious, but he comes off more like a real nice, frank, down-to-Earth guy. Just the kind of guy you'd like to sit down and have a beer with. The kind of guy you'd more than like to get smashed with. The kind of guy you'd really like to have ill advised unprotected sex with. The kind of guy you'd love to raise a bastard child with.

"A set of vipers has been taken by the scientists, and they have mutated them to make a cure for cancer... then their experiment goes awry, and all these vipers escape into the woods, and they are not only biting people, they are actually killing people, in a little town.I had low expectations because of Tara Reid, but frankly she was no worse than anyone else in the movie and may actually have even been good by comparison. I hate to almost say a good word about Reid, but there it is, the closest I may ever come.The problem with this film is easy to point out: the special effects. Snakes that take over an island and eat people (apparently including their clothes, bones and tents)? Sounds pretty good, like a classic 1950s sci-fi movie. Well, not this time. The snakes look so poor, they just ruin every scene they are in (which is most of the movie). SyFy has made a lot of poor special effects decisions, but this may be their worst.",disgust

"The whit’ning ground           In frost is bound;    The snow is swiftly falling; While coldly blows the northern breeze, And whistles through the leafless trees,    In hollow sounds appalling.             On this cold plain,           Now reach’d with pain,    Once stood my father’s dwelling: Where smiling pleasure once was found, Now desolation frowns around,    And wintry blasts are yelling.             Hope’s visions wild           My thoughts beguil’d,    My earliest days delighting, Till unsuspected treach’ry came, Beneath affection’s specious name,    The lovely prospect blighting.             With many a wile           Of blackest guile    Did Henry first deceive me: What winning words to him were giv’n! He swore, by all the pow’rs of Heav’n,    That he would never leave me.             With fondest truth           I lov’d the youth:    My soul, to guilt a stranger, Knew not, in those too simple hours, That oft beneath the sweetest flow’rs    Is couch’d the deadliest danger.             With him to roam           I fled my home;    I burst the bonds of duty; I thought my days in joy would roll; But Henry hid a demon’s soul    Beneath an angel’s beauty!             Shall this poor heart           E’er cease to smart?    Oh never! never! never! Did av’rice whisper thee, or pride, False Henry! for a wealthier bride    To cast me off for ever?             My sire was poor:           No golden store    Had he, no earthly treasure: I only could his griefs assuage, The only pillar of his age,    His only source of pleasure.             With anguish wild,           He miss’d his child,    And long in vain he sought her: The fiercest thunder-bolts of heav’n Shall on thy guilty head be driv’n,    Thou Disobedient Daughter!             I feel his fears,           I see his tears,    I hear his groans of sadness: My cruel falsehood seal’d his doom: He seems to curse me from the tomb,    And fire my brain to madness!             Oh! keenly blow,           While drifts the snow,    The cold nocturnal breezes; On me the gath’ring snow-flakes rest, And colder grows my friendless breast;    My very heart-blood freezes!             ‘Tis midnight deep,           And thousands sleep,    Unknown to guilt and sorrow; They think not of a wretch like me, Who cannot, dare not, hope to see    The rising light to-morrow!             An outcast hurl’d           From all the world,    Whom none would love or cherish, What now remains to end my woes, But here, amid the deep’ning snows,    To lay me down and perish?             Death’s icy dart           Invades my heart:    Just Heav’n! all-good! all-seeing! Thy matchless mercy I implore, When I must wake, to sleep no more,    In realms of endless being!",love

P. entered a third spacefrom which he could watch time passinstead of walking to the monasteryin the middle of the night. His opaque sexuality derived from the absenceof a guarantee that his person would remain intact. He recognized this in himselfand we stared at the pylons regressinginto the lackluster northeastern woods. The monastery was a displaybefore which he claimed sangfroida picturesque ruin to which he was conveyedas though by boreal fluid. Everyone loved occasional works like thistheir allusions to complementary and absent events. Weaving around proliferating drywallI despaired over this desire. P. joined the migrant workforceand grew more disconsolate and distantand drunk in our presence.

He looks like the center of the universe. Look how his mouth moves mouthing the words while the others are busy making more of him.

She on the hills which wantonlyAllureth all, in hope to be   By her preferr'd,Hath kiss'd so long her painted shrines,That ev'n her face by kissing shines,   For her reward. She in the valley is so shyOf dressing, that her hair doth lie   About her ears;While she avoids her neighbour's pride,She wholly goes on th' other side,   And nothing wears. But, dearest mother, what those miss,The mean, thy praise and glory is   And long may be.Blessed be God, whose love it wasTo double-moat thee with his grace,   And none but thee.",love

Common beauties stay fifteen;    Such as yours should swifter move, Whose fair blossoms are too green    Yet for lust, but not for love. love as much the snowy lamb,    Or the wanton kid, does prize, As the lusty bull or ram,    For his morning sacrifice. Now then love me: time may take    Thee before thy time away: Of this need we’ll virtue make,    And learn love before we may. So we win of doubtful fate;    And if good she to us meant, We that good shall antedate,    Or, if ill, that ill prevent. Thus as kingdoms, frustrating    Other titles to their crown, In the cradle crown their king,    So all foreign claims to drown, So, to make all rivals vain,    Now I crown thee with my love: Crown me with thy love again,    And we both shall monarchs prove.",love

"Far far from gusty waves these children's faces.Like rootless weeds, the hair torn round their pallor:The tall girl with her weighed-down head. The paper-seeming boy, with rat's eyes. The stunted, unlucky heirOf twisted bones, reciting a father's gnarled disease,His lesson, from his desk. At back of the dim classOne unnoted, sweet and young. His eyes live in a dreamOf squirrel's game, in tree room, other than this.On sour cream walls, donations. Shakespeare's head,Cloudless at dawn, civilized dome riding all cities.Belled, flowery, Tyrolese valley. Open-handed mapAwarding the world its world. And yet, for theseChildren, these windows, not this map, their world,Where all their future's painted with a fog,A narrow street sealed in with a lead skyFar far from rivers, capes, and stars of words.Surely, Shakespeare is wicked, the map a bad example.With ships and sun and love tempting them to steal —For lives that slyly turn in their cramped holesFrom fog to endless night? On their slag heap, these childrenWear skins peeped through by bones and spectacles of steelWith mended glass, like bottle bits on stones.All of their time and space are foggy slum.So blot their maps with slums as big as doom.Unless, governor, inspector, visitor,This map becomes their window and these windowsThat shut upon their lives like catacombs,Break O break open till they break the townAnd show the children to green fields, and make their worldRun azure on gold sands, and let their tonguesRun naked into books the white and green leaves openHistory theirs whose language is the sun.",love

They need to feel they stillcan touch and still be touched, as once they didand were, and one would have to be a cold,uncaring woman to deny their pleas:a woman with a bulletproof  heart,without a memory of life on earth.",love

"Oh mighty City of New York! you are wonderful to behold, Your buildings are magnificent, the truth be it told, They were the only thing that seemed to arrest my eye, Because many of them are thirteen storeys high. And as for Central Park, it is lovely to be seen, Especially in the summer season when its shrubberies and trees are green; And the Burns’ statue is there to be seen, Surrounded by trees, on the beautiful sward so green; Also Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott, Which by Englishmen and Scotchmen will ne’er be forgot. There the people on the Sabbath-day in thousands resort, All loud, in conversation and searching for sport, Some of them viewing the menagerie of wild beasts there, And also beautiful black swans, I do declare. And there’s beautiful boats to be seen there, And the joyous shouts of the children do rend the air, While the boats sail along with them o’er Lohengrin Lake, And the fare is five cents for children and adults ten is all they take. And there’s also summer-house shades and merry-go-rounds, And with the merry laughter of the children the Park resounds During the livelong Sabbath day, Enjoying the merry-go-round play. Then there’s the elevated railroads, about five storeys high, Which the inhabitants can see and hear night and day passing by, Oh! such a mass of people daily do throng, No less than five hundred thousand daily pass along, And all along the City you can get for five cents, And, believe me, among the passengers there are few discontent. And the top of the houses are all flat, And in the warm weather the people gather to chat, Besides on the house-tops they dry their clothes, And also many people all night on the house-tops repose. And numerous ships and steamboats are there to be seen, Sailing along the East River Water so green; ’Tis certainly a most beautiful sight To see them sailing o’er the smooth water day and night. And Brooklyn Bridge is a very great height, And fills the stranger’s heart with wonder at first sight, But with all its loftiness, I venture to say, For beauty it cannot surpass the new Railway Bridge of the Silvery Tay. And there’s also ten thousand rumsellers there, Oh! wonderful to think, I do declare! To accommodate the people of That city therein, And to encourage them to commit all sorts of sin. And on the Sabbath-day, ye will see many a man Going for beer with a tin can, And seems proud to be seen carrying home the beer To treat his neighbours and family dear. Then at night numbers of the people dance and sing, Making the walls of their houses to ring With their songs and dancing on Sabbath night, Which I witnessed with disgust, and fled from the sight. And with regard to New York and the sights I did see, One street in Dundee is more worth to me, And, believe me, the morning I sailed from New York For Bonnie Dundee, my heart it felt as light as a cork.",love

"Remember when you love, from that same hour Your peace you put into your lover’s power; From that same hour from him you laws receive, And as he shall ordain, you joy, or grieve, Hope, fear, laugh, weep; Reason aloof does stand, Disabled both to act, and to command. Oh cruel fetters! rather wish to feel On your soft limbs, the galling weight of steel; Rather to bloody wounds oppose your breast. No ill, by which the body can be pressed You will so sensible a torment find As shackles on your captived mind. The mind from heaven its high descent did draw, And brooks uneasily any other law Than what from Reason dictated shall be. Reason, a kind of innate deity, Which only can adapt to ev’ry soul A yoke so fit and light, that the control All liberty excels; so sweet a sway, The same ’tis to be happy, and obey; Commands so wise, and with rewards so dressed, That the according soul replies “I’m blessed.”",love

Like something half-remembered from a dreamthey come from places we have never seen. They chatter and they squawk and sometimes scream. Here the macaw clings at the rings to showthe young galahs talking as they feedwith feathers soft and pink as dawn on snowthat it too has a dry and dusky tongue.Their murmuring embraces every needfrom languid vanity to wildest greed. In the far corner sit two smoky cronestheir heads together in a kind of love.One cleans the other’s feathers while it moans.The others seem to whisper behind fanswhile noble dandies gamble in a roomasserting values everyone rejects.

"St. Agnes' Eve—Ah, bitter chill it was!        The owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold;        The hare limp'd trembling through the frozen grass,        And silent was the flock in woolly fold:        Numb were the Beadsman's fingers, while he told        His rosary, and while his frosted breath,        Like pious incense from a censer old,        Seem'd taking flight for heaven, without a death, Past the sweet Virgin's picture, while his prayer he saith.        His prayer he saith, this patient, holy man;        Then takes his lamp, and riseth from his knees,        And back returneth, meagre, barefoot, wan,        Along the chapel aisle by slow degrees:        The sculptur'd dead, on each side, seem to freeze,        Emprison'd in black, purgatorial rails:        Knights, ladies, praying in dumb orat'ries,        He passeth by; and his weak spirit fails To think how they may ache in icy hoods and mails.        Northward he turneth through a little door,        And scarce three steps, ere Music's golden tongue        Flatter'd to tears this aged man and poor;        But no—already had his deathbell rung;        The joys of all his life were said and sung:        His was harsh penance on St. Agnes' Eve:        Another way he went, and soon among        Rough ashes sat he for his soul's reprieve, And all night kept awake, for sinners' sake to grieve.        That ancient Beadsman heard the prelude soft;        And so it chanc'd, for many a door was wide,        From hurry to and fro. Soon, up aloft,        The silver, snarling trumpets 'gan to chide:        The level chambers, ready with their pride,        Were glowing to receive a thousand guests:        The carved angels, ever eager-eyed,        Star'd, where upon their heads the cornice rests, With hair blown back, and wings put cross-wise on their breasts.        At length burst in the argent revelry,        With plume, tiara, and all rich array,        Numerous as shadows haunting faerily        The brain, new stuff'd, in youth, with triumphs gay        Of old romance. These let us wish away,        And turn, sole-thoughted, to one Lady there,        Whose heart had brooded, all that wintry day,        On love, and wing'd St. Agnes' saintly care, As she had heard old dames full many times declare.        They told her how, upon St. Agnes' Eve,        Young virgins might have visions of delight,        And soft adorings from their loves receive        Upon the honey'd middle of the night,        If ceremonies due they did aright;        As, supperless to bed they must retire,        And couch supine their beauties, lily white;        Nor look behind, nor sideways, but require Of Heaven with upward eyes for all that they desire.        Full of this whim was thoughtful Madeline:        The music, yearning like a God in pain,        She scarcely heard: her maiden eyes divine,        Fix'd on the floor, saw many a sweeping train        Pass by—she heeded not at all: in vain        Came many a tiptoe, amorous cavalier,        And back retir'd; not cool'd by high disdain,        But she saw not: her heart was otherwhere: She sigh'd for Agnes' dreams, the sweetest of the year.        She danc'd along with vague, regardless eyes,        Anxious her lips, her breathing quick and short:        The hallow'd hour was near at hand: she sighs        Amid the timbrels, and the throng'd resort        Of whisperers in anger, or in sport;        'Mid looks of love, defiance, hate, and scorn,        Hoodwink'd with faery fancy; all amort,        Save to St. Agnes and her lambs unshorn, And all the bliss to be before to-morrow morn.        So, purposing each moment to retire,        She linger'd still. Meantime, across the moors,        Had come young Porphyro, with heart on fire        For Madeline. Beside the portal doors,        Buttress'd from moonlight, stands he, and implores        All saints to give him sight of Madeline,        But for one moment in the tedious hours,        That he might gaze and worship all unseen; Perchance speak, kneel, touch, kiss—in sooth such things have been.        He ventures in: let no buzz'd whisper tell:        All eyes be muffled, or a hundred swords        Will storm his heart, love's fev'rous citadel:        For him, those chambers held barbarian hordes,        Hyena foemen, and hot-blooded lords,        Whose very dogs would execrations howl        Against his lineage: not one breast affords        Him any mercy, in that mansion foul, Save one old beldame, weak in body and in soul.        Ah, happy chance! the aged creature came,        Shuffling along with ivory-headed wand,        To where he stood, hid from the torch's flame,        Behind a broad half-pillar, far beyond        The sound of merriment and chorus bland:        He startled her; but soon she knew his face,        And grasp'd his fingers in her palsied hand,        Saying, ""Mercy, Porphyro! hie thee from this place; They are all here to-night, the whole blood-thirsty race!        ""Get hence! get hence! there's dwarfish Hildebrand;        He had a fever late, and in the fit        He cursed thee and thine, both house and land:        Then there's that old Lord Maurice, not a whit        More tame for his gray hairs—Alas me! flit!        Flit like a ghost away.""—""Ah, Gossip dear,        We're safe enough; here in this arm-chair sit,        And tell me how""—""Good Saints! not here, not here; Follow me, child, or else these stones will be thy bier.""        He follow'd through a lowly arched way,        Brushing the cobwebs with his lofty plume,        And as she mutter'd ""Well-a—well-a-day!""        He found him in a little moonlight room,        Pale, lattic'd, chill, and silent as a tomb.        ""Now tell me where is Madeline,"" said he,        ""O tell me, Angela, by the holy loom        Which none but secret sisterhood may see, When they St. Agnes' wool are weaving piously.""        ""St. Agnes! Ah! it is St. Agnes' Eve—        Yet men will murder upon holy days:        Thou must hold water in a witch's sieve,        And be liege-lord of all the Elves and Fays,        To venture so: it fills me with amaze        To see thee, Porphyro!—St. Agnes' Eve!        God's help! my lady fair the conjuror plays        This very night: good angels her deceive! But let me laugh awhile, I've mickle time to grieve.""        Feebly she laugheth in the languid moon,        While Porphyro upon her face doth look,        Like puzzled urchin on an aged crone        Who keepeth clos'd a wond'rous riddle-book,        As spectacled she sits in chimney nook.        But soon his eyes grew brilliant, when she told        His lady's purpose; and he scarce could brook        Tears, at the thought of those enchantments cold, And Madeline asleep in lap of legends old.        Sudden a thought came like a full-blown rose,        Flushing his brow, and in his pained heart        Made purple riot: then doth he propose        A stratagem, that makes the beldame start:        ""A cruel man and impious thou art:        Sweet lady, let her pray, and sleep, and dream        Alone with her good angels, far apart        From wicked men like thee. Go, go!—I deem Thou canst not surely be the same that thou didst seem.""        ""I will not harm her, by all saints I swear,""        Quoth Porphyro: ""O may I ne'er find grace        When my weak voice shall whisper its last prayer,        If one of her soft ringlets I displace,        Or look with ruffian passion in her face:        Good Angela, believe me by these tears;        Or I will, even in a moment's space,        Awake, with horrid shout, my foemen's ears, And beard them, though they be more fang'd than wolves and bears.""        ""Ah! why wilt thou affright a feeble soul?        A poor, weak, palsy-stricken, churchyard thing,        Whose passing-bell may ere the midnight toll;        Whose prayers for thee, each morn and evening,        Were never miss'd.""—Thus plaining, doth she bring        A gentler speech from burning Porphyro;        So woful, and of such deep sorrowing,        That Angela gives promise she will do Whatever he shall wish, betide her weal or woe.        Which was, to lead him, in close secrecy,        Even to Madeline's chamber, and there hide        Him in a closet, of such privacy        That he might see her beauty unespy'd,        And win perhaps that night a peerless bride,        While legion'd faeries pac'd the coverlet,        And pale enchantment held her sleepy-ey'd.        Never on such a night have lovers met, Since Merlin paid his Demon all the monstrous debt.        ""It shall be as thou wishest,"" said the Dame:        ""All cates and dainties shall be stored there        Quickly on this feast-night: by the tambour frame        Her own lute thou wilt see: no time to spare,        For I am slow and feeble, and scarce dare        On such a catering trust my dizzy head.        Wait here, my child, with patience; kneel in prayer        The while: Ah! thou must needs the lady wed, Or may I never leave my grave among the dead.""        So saying, she hobbled off with busy fear.        The lover's endless minutes slowly pass'd;        The dame return'd, and whisper'd in his ear        To follow her; with aged eyes aghast        From fright of dim espial. Safe at last,        Through many a dusky gallery, they gain        The maiden's chamber, silken, hush'd, and chaste;        Where Porphyro took covert, pleas'd amain. His poor guide hurried back with agues in her brain.        Her falt'ring hand upon the balustrade,        Old Angela was feeling for the stair,        When Madeline, St. Agnes' charmed maid,        Rose, like a mission'd spirit, unaware:        With silver taper's light, and pious care,        She turn'd, and down the aged gossip led        To a safe level matting. Now prepare,        Young Porphyro, for gazing on that bed; She comes, she comes again, like ring-dove fray'd and fled.        Out went the taper as she hurried in;        Its little smoke, in pallid moonshine, died:        She clos'd the door, she panted, all akin        To spirits of the air, and visions wide:        No uttered syllable, or, woe betide!        But to her heart, her heart was voluble,        Paining with eloquence her balmy side;        As though a tongueless nightingale should swell Her throat in vain, and die, heart-stifled, in her dell.        A casement high and triple-arch'd there was,        All garlanded with carven imag'ries        Of fruits, and flowers, and bunches of knot-grass,        And diamonded with panes of quaint device,        Innumerable of stains and splendid dyes,        As are the tiger-moth's deep-damask'd wings;        And in the midst, 'mong thousand heraldries,        And twilight saints, and dim emblazonings, A shielded scutcheon blush'd with blood of queens and kings.        Full on this casement shone the wintry moon,        And threw warm gules on Madeline's fair breast,        As down she knelt for heaven's grace and boon;        Rose-bloom fell on her hands, together prest,        And on her silver cross soft amethyst,        And on her hair a glory, like a saint:        She seem'd a splendid angel, newly drest,        Save wings, for heaven:—Porphyro grew faint: She knelt, so pure a thing, so free from mortal taint.        Anon his heart revives: her vespers done,        Of all its wreathed pearls her hair she frees;        Unclasps her warmed jewels one by one;        Loosens her fragrant boddice; by degrees        Her rich attire creeps rustling to her knees:        Half-hidden, like a mermaid in sea-weed,        Pensive awhile she dreams awake, and sees,        In fancy, fair St. Agnes in her bed, But dares not look behind, or all the charm is fled.        Soon, trembling in her soft and chilly nest,        In sort of wakeful swoon, perplex'd she lay,        Until the poppied warmth of sleep oppress'd        Her soothed limbs, and soul fatigued away;        Flown, like a thought, until the morrow-day;        Blissfully haven'd both from joy and pain;        Clasp'd like a missal where swart Paynims pray;        Blinded alike from sunshine and from rain, As though a rose should shut, and be a bud again.        Stol'n to this paradise, and so entranced,        Porphyro gaz'd upon her empty dress,        And listen'd to her breathing, if it chanced        To wake into a slumberous tenderness;        Which when he heard, that minute did he bless,        And breath'd himself: then from the closet crept,        Noiseless as fear in a wide wilderness,        And over the hush'd carpet, silent, stept, And 'tween the curtains peep'd, where, lo!—how fast she slept.        Then by the bed-side, where the faded moon        Made a dim, silver twilight, soft he set        A table, and, half anguish'd, threw thereon        A cloth of woven crimson, gold, and jet:—        O for some drowsy Morphean amulet!        The boisterous, midnight, festive clarion,        The kettle-drum, and far-heard clarinet,        Affray his ears, though but in dying tone:— The hall door shuts again, and all the noise is gone.        And still she slept an azure-lidded sleep,        In blanched linen, smooth, and lavender'd,        While he forth from the closet brought a heap        Of candied apple, quince, and plum, and gourd;        With jellies soother than the creamy curd,        And lucent syrops, tinct with cinnamon;        Manna and dates, in argosy transferr'd        From Fez; and spiced dainties, every one, From silken Samarcand to cedar'd Lebanon.        These delicates he heap'd with glowing hand        On golden dishes and in baskets bright        Of wreathed silver: sumptuous they stand        In the retired quiet of the night,        Filling the chilly room with perfume light.—        ""And now, my love, my seraph fair, awake!        Thou art my heaven, and I thine eremite:        Open thine eyes, for meek St. Agnes' sake, Or I shall drowse beside thee, so my soul doth ache.""        Thus whispering, his warm, unnerved arm        Sank in her pillow. Shaded was her dream        By the dusk curtains:—'twas a midnight charm        Impossible to melt as iced stream:        The lustrous salvers in the moonlight gleam;        Broad golden fringe upon the carpet lies:        It seem'd he never, never could redeem        From such a stedfast spell his lady's eyes; So mus'd awhile, entoil'd in woofed phantasies.        Awakening up, he took her hollow lute,—        Tumultuous,—and, in chords that tenderest be,        He play'd an ancient ditty, long since mute,        In Provence call'd, ""La belle dame sans mercy"":        Close to her ear touching the melody;—        Wherewith disturb'd, she utter'd a soft moan:        He ceas'd—she panted quick—and suddenly        Her blue affrayed eyes wide open shone: Upon his knees he sank, pale as smooth-sculptured stone.        Her eyes were open, but she still beheld,        Now wide awake, the vision of her sleep:        There was a painful change, that nigh expell'd        The blisses of her dream so pure and deep        At which fair Madeline began to weep,        And moan forth witless words with many a sigh;        While still her gaze on Porphyro would keep;        Who knelt, with joined hands and piteous eye, fearing to move or speak, she look'd so dreamingly.        ""Ah, Porphyro!"" said she, ""but even now        Thy voice was at sweet tremble in mine ear,        Made tuneable with every sweetest vow;        And those sad eyes were spiritual and clear:        How chang'd thou art! how pallid, chill, and drear!        Give me that voice again, my Porphyro,        Those looks immortal, those complainings dear!        Oh leave me not in this eternal woe, For if thy diest, my love, I know not where to go.""        Beyond a mortal man impassion'd far        At these voluptuous accents, he arose        Ethereal, flush'd, and like a throbbing star        Seen mid the sapphire heaven's deep repose;        Into her dream he melted, as the rose        Blendeth its odour with the violet,—        Solution sweet: meantime the frost-wind blows        Like love's alarum pattering the sharp sleet Against the window-panes; St. Agnes' moon hath set.        'Tis dark: quick pattereth the flaw-blown sleet:        ""This is no dream, my bride, my Madeline!""        'Tis dark: the iced gusts still rave and beat:        ""No dream, alas! alas! and woe is mine!        Porphyro will leave me here to fade and pine.—        Cruel! what traitor could thee hither bring?        I curse not, for my heart is lost in thine,        Though thou forsakest a deceived thing;— A dove forlorn and lost with sick unpruned wing.""        ""My Madeline! sweet dreamer! lovely bride!        Say, may I be for aye thy vassal blest?        Thy beauty's shield, heart-shap'd and vermeil dyed?        Ah, silver shrine, here will I take my rest        After so many hours of toil and quest,        A famish'd pilgrim,—sav'd by miracle.        Though I have found, I will not rob thy nest        Saving of thy sweet self; if thou think'st well To trust, fair Madeline, to no rude infidel.        ""Hark! 'tis an elfin-storm from faery land,        Of haggard seeming, but a boon indeed:        Arise—arise! the morning is at hand;—        The bloated wassaillers will never heed:—        Let us away, my love, with happy speed;        There are no ears to hear, or eyes to see,—        Drown'd all in Rhenish and the sleepy mead:        Awake! arise! my love, and fearless be, For o'er the southern moors I have a home for thee.""        She hurried at his words, beset with fears,        For there were sleeping dragons all around,        At glaring watch, perhaps, with ready spears—        Down the wide stairs a darkling way they found.—        In all the house was heard no human sound.        A chain-droop'd lamp was flickering by each door;        The arras, rich with horseman, hawk, and hound,        Flutter'd in the besieging wind's uproar; And the long carpets rose along the gusty floor.        They glide, like phantoms, into the wide hall;        Like phantoms, to the iron porch, they glide;        Where lay the Porter, in uneasy sprawl,        With a huge empty flaggon by his side:        The wakeful bloodhound rose, and shook his hide,        But his sagacious eye an inmate owns:        By one, and one, the bolts full easy slide:—        The chains lie silent on the footworn stones;— The key turns, and the door upon its hinges groans.        And they are gone: ay, ages long ago        These lovers fled away into the storm.        That night the Baron dreamt of many a woe,        And all his warrior-guests, with shade and form        Of witch, and demon, and large coffin-worm,        Were long be-nightmar'd. Angela the old        Died palsy-twitch'd, with meagre face deform;        The Beadsman, after thousand aves told, For aye unsought for slept among his ashes cold.",love

"Regla lesbia: Flexible rule that may be adjusted to anybody to be measured. Compare regla fija: standard.                                                     —The Velázquez DictionaryI.In the garden, it’s there. Even when you’re inside you feel it,as though it were you standing naked among the weeds, the tips of the bougainvillea bursting into flame, your nipplesruffled like the skin of a lake by a breeze. You worship the invisible body like an old-fashioned lover, from afar,loving the specificity of space between you. Sometimes at night it stretches out on the empty sideof the bed, stares at you with the length of its invisible surface. Every contour of your body not filled by you is moldedby the attentiveness of the invisible body, whose breath surrounds     you. It’s more than prayer it wants—more than language, with its     conditions.The invisible body demands you invent new senses to receive it, new places on your body to marvel at its subtlety,like the eyes of the deaf percussionist that perceive sound. II.The invisible body wants you to become a satellite dish,tuned to what exists only because your body calls to it. Like the woman who had her kitchen remodeled to make roomfor the microwave she’d entered a contest for. Then won. III.When asked whether falling in love was about acquisitiveness,about the ego, the seventy-five-year-old poet responded that the ego had nothing to do with it;it was the need for union with the beloved. Rumi asks, Who is it we spend our entire lives loving?  IV.How, then, do you measure the invisible body,which resists commitment but is faithful? Is it clear who the beloved is, when no clearbody exists that can be measured against a standard? V.The invisible body sometimes acquires a body—it’s so convincing,it takes you a while to figure out it’s really the invisible body. Like someone who has been reading your journal,it has decoded from your petty, daily complaints the open sesame that slides the stone from the hidden cave’s openingand cleans you out while you sleep, leaving a sarcastic note. It wants you to know it was doing you a favor, besides,how else did you think you’d discover the cave’s precise location? When Aphrodite sharpens you, you sacrifice a little of yourself,willingly, as a knife does, so that you may become better at it. VI.This is the point at which the invisible body speaksin italics, the Ouija board of poetry. In my mind, says the invisible body, that time capsule shuttlingthrough space, I hold, in all the languages of the world, your love, rushed like holographic platters to a table,steaming into the future long after you’ve ceased to shine, the silver faces of your beloved bobbing out of the darkness,the black velvet pillow of your life on which you offer them for view. VII.The invisible body is created out of your longing, your longingcompressing invisible molecules together into an absence you     recognize. That is the way one blind man sees the world—after the fact,in photographs he took, once he had passed through it.",love

"Too busy peddling my fire and trying to keep the mouths fedand packing up belongings of the recent dead right now to accessyour luxurious philosophy, though one looks forward to a timewhen the universe permits, I said to my electric correspondentwho came at me puffed pink in thoughtfulness when what I neededthen as now was a quiet high enough to envision a half-gallonbrick of all-natural vanilla ice cream softening on the hot hoodof an idling cop car: the earliest rivulets, a slow loss of strictrectangularity, then the wild gliding around on the beautiful bleakenamel paint job as its sweet fragrance fills the air like a giftfrom Madagascar I can breathe. Rapt Cortés transported cuttingsof vanilla across the Atlantic during his plunder of the Aztecs;the Aztecs themselves fell captive to its magic after vanquishingits first cultivators the Totonacs, who paid their conquerors tributesof baskets stacked to heaven with cured vanilla pods like longsentences of salutiferous essence. This is one of those instanceshistory likes to push your face into to try to stir your appetitefor cruelty a little, or at least make you covet the perks of it: I toowant vanilla in quantity. I want it all around me, like a fortressof mellow dangles. It will move with me as I move and it will wardhateful people off. For centuries Europeans tried to cultivate itoutside its native Mexico and failed. They could get the vineto flower, but in the absence of ancestral pollinators, specificallyhummingbirds and a stingless bee, the flowers dropped off podless.Meanwhile, Edmond Albius—born into slavery on an islandeast of Madagascar known then as Bourbon, lush French colonyand home to roses, one active volcano, one dormant, and onearena-like caldera that holds the record for most rainfall shedin one location by a single tropical cyclone ever, namely Hyacinthe—knew enough from orchids at age twelve in 1841 to think to liftwith a bamboo splint the flap of the rostellum dividing the pollen-heavy male anther from the female stigma in order to rub the pollenon the stigma’s eager wand. Within weeks the pods had begunto form and lengthen into joyous beanlike squiggles laden withtiny seeds like secrets of the universe as Albius at the shore and underbright southern stars breathed out I hope in a kind of enlargementakin to liberty from time, so that on that occasion he might feelbriefly as if his own, even as his method of vanilla pollinationbelonged first to his master, then Madagascar, and then the world,with nearly all vanilla produced today as Albius taught us, includingthe kind in Breyers since 1866, fourteen years before Albius diedunrecognized, in poverty, in misery to be exact, while everyone whitearound him grew rich with vanilla, adding it to candy, Coca-Cola,Chanel No. 5, and even in effigy to the air freshener danglingdown in my Uber, its waves whispering Albius, Albius, but inaudibly.",love

"The gallant Youth, who may have gained,   Or seeks, a ""winsome Marrow,""Was but an Infant in the lap   When first I looked on Yarrow;Once more, by Newark's Castle-gate   Long left without a warder,I stood, looked, listened, and with Thee,   Great Minstrel of the Border!Grave thoughts ruled wide on that sweet day,   Their dignity installingIn gentle bosoms, while sere leaves   Were on the bough, or falling;But breezes played, and sunshine gleamed-   The forest to embolden;Reddened the fiery hues, and shot   Transparence through the golden.For busy thoughts the Stream flowed on   In foamy agitation;And slept in many a crystal pool   For quiet contemplation:No public and no private care   The freeborn mind enthralling,We made a day of happy hours,   Our happy days recalling.Brisk Youth appeared, the Morn of youth,   With freaks of graceful folly,-Life's temperate Noon, her sober Eve,   Her Night not melancholy;Past, present, future, all appeared   In harmony united,Like guests that meet, and some from far,   By cordial love invited.And if, as Yarrow, through the woods   And down the meadow ranging,Did meet us with unaltered face,   Though we were changed and changing;If, then, some natural shadows spread   Our inward prospect over,The soul's deep valley was not slow   Its brightness to recover.Eternal blessings on the Muse,   And her divine employment!The blameless Muse, who trains her Sons   For hope and calm enjoyment;Albeit sickness, lingering yet,   Has o'er their pillow brooded;And Care waylays their steps-a Sprite   Not easily eluded.For thee, O Scott! compelled to change   Green Eildon-hill and CheviotFor warm Vesuvio's vine-clad slopes;   And leave thy Tweed and TiviotFor mild Sorrento's breezy waves;   May classic Fancy, linkingWith native Fancy her fresh aid,   Preserve thy heart from sinking!Oh! while they minister to thee,   Each vying with the other,May Health return to mellow Age   With Strength, her venturous brother;And Tiber, and each brook and rill   Renowned in song and story,With unimagined beauty shine,   Nor lose one ray of glory!For Thou, upon a hundred streams,   By tales of love and sorrow,Of faithful love, undaunted truth   Hast shed the power of Yarrow;And streams unknown, hills yet unseen,   Wherever they invite Thee,At parent Nature's grateful call,   With gladness must requite Thee.A gracious welcome shall be thine,   Such looks of love and honourAs thy own Yarrow gave to me   When first I gazed upon her;Beheld what I had feared to see,   Unwilling to surrenderDreams treasured up from early days,   The holy and the tender.And what, for this frail world, were all   That mortals do or suffer,Did no responsive harp, no pen,   Memorial tribute offer?Yea, what were mighty Nature's self?   Her features, could they win us,Unhelped by the poetic voice   That hourly speaks within us?Nor deem that localized Romance   Plays false with our affections;Unsanctifies our tears-made sport   For fanciful dejections:Ah, no! the visions of the past   Sustain the heart in feelingLife as she is-our changeful Life,   With friends and kindred dealing.Bear witness, Ye, whose thoughts that day   In Yarrow's groves were centred;Who through the silent portal arch   Of mouldering Newark entered;And clomb the winding stair that once   Too timidly was mountedBy the ""last Minstrel,""(not the last!)   Ere he his Tale recounted.Flow on for ever, Yarrow Stream!   Fulfil thy pensive duty,Well pleased that future Bards should chant   For simple hearts thy beauty;To dream-light dear while yet unseen,   Dear to the common sunshine,And dearer still, as now I feel,   To memory's shadowy moonshine!",love

"Farewell thou thing, time past so known, so dear To me as blood to life and spirit; near, Nay, thou more near than kindred, friend, man, wife, Male to the female, soul to body; life To quick action, or the warm soft side Of the resigning, yet resisting bride. The kiss of virgins, first fruits of the bed, Soft speech, smooth touch, the lips, the maidenhead : These and a thousand sweets could never be So near or dear as thou wast once to me. O thou, the drink of gods and angels! wine That scatter'st spirit and lust, whose purest shine More radiant than the summer's sunbeam shows; Each way illustrious, brave, and like to those Comets we see by night, whose shagg'd portents Foretell the coming of some dire events, Or some full flame which with a pride aspires, Throwing about his wild and active fires; 'Tis thou, above nectar, O divinest soul ! Eternal in thyself, that can'st control That which subverts whole nature, grief and care, Vexation of the mind, and damn'd despair. 'Tis thou alone who, with thy mystic fan, Workst more than wisdom, art, or nature can To rouse the sacred madness and awake The frost-bound blood and spirits, and to make Them frantic with thy raptures flashing through The soul like lightning, and as active too. 'Tis not Apollo can, or those thrice three Castalian sisters, sing, if wanting thee. Horace, Anacreon, both had lost their fame, Hads't thou not fill'd them with thy fire and flame. Phoebean splendour! and thou, Thespian spring! Of which sweet swans must drink before they sing Their true pac'd numbers and their holy lays, Which makes them worthy cedar and the bays. But why, why longer do I gaze upon Thee with the eye of admiration? Since I must leave thee, and enforc'd must say To all thy witching beauties, Go away. But if thy whimpering looks do ask me why, Then know that nature bids thee go, not I. 'Tis her erroneous self has made a brain Uncapable of such a sovereign As is thy powerful self.   Prithee not smile, Or smile more inly, lest thy looks beguile My vows denounc'd in zeal, which thus much show thee That I have sworn but by thy looks to know thee. Let others drink thee freely, and desire Thee and their lips espous'd, while I admire And love thee, but not taste thee. Let my muse Fail of thy former helps, and only use Her inadultrate strength: what's done by me Hereafter shall smell of the lamp, not thee.",love

"I Ere frost-flower and snow-blossom faded and fell, and the splendour of winter had passed out of sight, The ways of the woodlands were fairer and stranger than dreams that fulfil us in sleep with delight; The breath of the mouths of the winds had hardened on tree-tops and branches that glittered and swayed Such wonders and glories of blossomlike snow or of frost that outlightens all flowers till it fade That the sea was not lovelier than here was the land, nor the night than the day, nor the day than the night, Nor the winter sublimer with storm than the spring: such mirth had the madness and might in thee made, March, master of winds, bright minstrel and marshal of storms that enkindle the season they smite. II And now that the rage of thy rapture is satiate with revel and ravin and spoil of the snow, And the branches it brightened are broken, and shattered the tree-tops that only thy wrath could lay low, How should not thy lovers rejoice in thee, leader and lord of the year that exults to be born So strong in thy strength and so glad of thy gladness whose laughter puts winter and sorrow to scorn? Thou hast shaken the snows from thy wings, and the frost on thy forehead is molten: thy lips are aglow As a lover's that kindle with kissing, and earth, with her raiment and tresses yet wasted and torn, Takes breath as she smiles in the grasp of thy passion to feel through her spirit the sense of thee flow. III Fain, fain would we see but again for an hour what the wind and the sun have dispelled and consumed, Those full deep swan-soft feathers of snow with whose luminous burden the branches implumed Hung heavily, curved as a half-bent bow, and fledged not as birds are, but petalled as flowers, Each tree-top and branchlet a pinnacle jewelled and carved, or a fountain that shines as it showers, But fixed as a fountain is fixed not, and wrought not to last till by time or by tempest entombed, As a pinnacle carven and gilded of men: for the date of its doom is no more than an hour's, One hour of the sun's when the warm wind wakes him to wither the snow-flowers that froze as they bloomed. IV As the sunshine quenches the snowshine; as April subdues thee, and yields up his kingdom to May; So time overcomes the regret that is born of delight as it passes in passion away, And leaves but a dream for desire to rejoice in or mourn for with tears or thanksgivings; but thou, Bright god that art gone from us, maddest and gladdest of months, to what goal hast thou gone from us now? For somewhere surely the storm of thy laughter that lightens, the beat of thy wings that play, Must flame as a fire through the world, and the heavens that we know not rejoice in thee: surely thy brow Hath lost not its radiance of empire, thy spirit the joy that impelled it on quest as for prey. V Are thy feet on the ways of the limitless waters, thy wings on the winds of the waste north sea? Are the fires of the false north dawn over heavens where summer is stormful and strong like thee Now bright in the sight of thine eyes? are the bastions of icebergs assailed by the blast of thy breath? Is it March with the wild north world when April is waning? the word that the changed year saith, Is it echoed to northward with rapture of passion reiterate from spirits triumphant as we Whose hearts were uplift at the blast of thy clarions as men's rearisen from a sleep that was death And kindled to life that was one with the world's and with thine? hast thou set not the whole world free? VI For the breath of thy lips is freedom, and freedom's the sense of thy spirit, the sound of thy song, Glad god of the north-east wind, whose heart is as high as the hands of thy kingdom are strong, Thy kingdom whose empire is terror and joy, twin-featured and fruitful of births divine, Days lit with the flame of the lamps of the flowers, and nights that are drunken with dew for wine, And sleep not for joy of the stars that deepen and quicken, a denser and fierier throng, And the world that thy breath bade whiten and tremble rejoices at heart as they strengthen and shine, And earth gives thanks for the glory bequeathed her, and knows of thy reign that it wrought not wrong. VII Thy spirit is quenched not, albeit we behold not thy face in the crown of the steep sky's arch, And the bold first buds of the whin wax golden, and witness arise of the thorn and the larch: Wild April, enkindled to laughter and storm by the kiss of the wildest of winds that blow, Calls loud on his brother for witness; his hands that were laden with blossom are sprinkled with snow, And his lips breathe winter, and laugh, and relent; and the live woods feel not the frost's flame parch; For the flame of the spring that consumes not but quickens is felt at the heart of the forest aglow, And the sparks that enkindled and fed it were strewn from the hands of the gods of the winds of March.",love

"When my grave is broke up again        Some second guest to entertain,        (For graves have learn'd that woman head,        To be to more than one a bed)                 And he that digs it, spies A bracelet of bright hair about the bone,                 Will he not let'us alone, And think that there a loving couple lies, Who thought that this device might be some way To make their souls, at the last busy day, Meet at this grave, and make a little stay?          If this fall in a time, or land,          Where mis-devotion doth command,          Then he, that digs us up, will bring          Us to the bishop, and the king,                 To make us relics; then Thou shalt be a Mary Magdalen, and I                 A something else thereby; All women shall adore us, and some men; And since at such time miracles are sought, I would have that age by this paper taught What miracles we harmless lovers wrought.          First, we lov'd well and faithfully,          Yet knew not what we lov'd, nor why;          Difference of sex no more we knew          Than our guardian angels do;                 Coming and going, we Perchance might kiss, but not between those meals;                 Our hands ne'er touch'd the seals Which nature, injur'd by late law, sets free; These miracles we did, but now alas, All measure, and all language, I should pass, Should I tell what a miracle she was.",love

"Before the glimmer of his sunken eyes,What question could I answer with my lies? Digesting everything, it’s all so plainIn him, his abdomen so thin the pain Is almost visible. I probe the lumpHis boyfriend noticed first, my left hand limp Beneath the pressure of the right. With AIDSYou have to think lymphoma—swollen nodes, A tender spleen, the liver’s jutting edge—It strikes me suddenly I will oblige This hunger that announces death is near,And as I touch him, cold and cavalier, The language of beneath the diaphragmHas told me where it’s coming from And where I’m going, too: soft skin to rocks,The body reveling until it wrecks Against the same internal, hidden shoal,The treasures we can’t hide, our swallowed gold.",love

"Come, my Celia, let us prove, While we can, the sports of love; Time will not be ours forever; He at length our good will sever. Spend not then his gifts in vain. Suns that set may rise again; But if once we lose this light, ’Tis with us perpetual night. Why should we defer our joys? Fame and rumor are but toys. Cannot we delude the eyes Of a few poor household spies, Or his easier ears beguile, So removèd by our wile? ’Tis no sin love’s fruit to steal; But the sweet thefts to reveal, To be taken, to be seen, These have crimes accounted been.",love

The flowers I planted along my roadHave lasted long despite winds and coldAlready fiery noons begin to burnSlyly the secret of the rootsAnd I know that of my footsteps nothing will remainBut a trace a cluster a dropTo recall along the paths I’ve chosenThose evening when the light sangIn eyes hands hearts and goblets.    I love the sweet harshness on the tongueFilling the palate with a promised salivaKnocking the mute keyboard of the teethWith raised draperies of which one might sayThat memory retains a fleeting trail of themHalf-glimpsed we won’t know how or elseThe loud reminder of the single momentAll gravity banished the unconscious pleasure recapturedOf being nothing but entirely animal.    For our life closed on that iridescent sphere—Color taste perfume at their extreme limits—invokes   Some miracle independent of its originProduced by distilling air and earth—Like the move toward technological planetsAfter a calculation made on the fingers of one hand—Time contained flowing—continual autumnThis evening this wine that enters me to makeMy head light my tongue loose my cock happy.,love

"Fair seedtime had my soul, and I grew up Fostered alike by beauty and by fear; Much favoured in my birthplace, and no less In that beloved Vale to which, erelong, I was transplanted ...—WILLIAM WORDSWORTH, The PreludeHe [the stable-boy] had a book of Orange rhymes, and the days when we read them together in the hay-loft gave me the pleasure of rhyme for the first time. Later on I can remember being told, when there was a rumour of a Fenian rising, that rifles were being handed out to the Orangemen; and presently, when I began to dream of my future life, I thought I would like to die fighting the Fenians.—W. B. YEATS, Autobiographies1. The Ministry of fear       for Seamus DeaneWell, as Kavanagh said, we have lived   In important places. The lonely scarpOf St Columb’s College, where I billeted   For six years, overlooked your Bogside.I gazed into new worlds: the inflamed throat   Of Brandywell, its floodlit dogtrack,   The throttle of the hare. In the first week   I was so homesick I couldn’t even eat   The biscuits left to sweeten my exile.   I threw them over the fence one night   In September 1951When the lights of houses in the Lecky Road   Were amber in the fog. It was an act   Of stealth.                  Then Belfast, and then Berkeley.Here’s two on’s are sophisticated,Dabbling in verses till they have become   A life: from bulky envelopes arriving   In vacation time to slim volumesDespatched `with the author’s compliments’.Those poems in longhand, ripped from the wire spine   Of your exercise book, bewildered me—Vowels and ideas bandied freeAs the seed-pods blowing off our sycamores.   I tried to write about the sycamoresAnd innovated a South Derry rhymeWith hushed and lulled full chimes for pushed and pulled.   Those hobnailed boots from beyond the mountain   Were walking, by God, all over the fine   Lawns of elocution.                              Have our accentsChanged? ‘Catholics, in general, don’t speakAs well as students from the Protestant schools.’   Remember that stuff? InferiorityComplexes, stuff that dreams were made on.   ‘What’s your name, Heaney?’                                          ‘Heaney, Father.’                                                                     ‘FairEnough.’             On my first day, the leather strapWent epileptic in the Big Study,Its echoes plashing over our bowed heads,But I still wrote home that a boarder’s lifeWas not so bad, shying as usual.On long vacations, then, I came to life   In the kissing seat of an Austin 16Parked at a gable, the engine running,   My fingers tight as ivy on her shoulders,   A light left burning for her in the kitchen.   And heading back for home, the summer’s   Freedom dwindling night by night, the air   All moonlight and a scent of hay, policemen   Swung their crimson flashlamps, crowding round   The car like black cattle, snuffing and pointingThe muzzle of a Sten gun in my eye:   ‘What’s your name, driver?’                                          ‘Seamus ...’                                                         Seamus?They once read my letters at a roadblockAnd shone their torches on your hieroglyphics,   ‘Svelte dictions’ in a very florid hand.Ulster was British, but with no rights on   The English lyric: all around us, though   We hadn’t named it, the ministry of fear.2. A Constable CallsHis bicycle stood at the window-sill,   The rubber cowl of a mud-splasher   Skirting the front mudguard,Its fat black handlegripsHeating in sunlight, the ‘spud’Of the dynamo gleaming and cocked back,   The pedal treads hanging relievedOf the boot of the law.His cap was upside downOn the floor, next his chair.The line of its pressure ran like a bevel   In his slightly sweating hair.He had unstrappedThe heavy ledger, and my father   Was making tillage returnsIn acres, roods, and perches.Arithmetic and fear.I sat staring at the polished holster   With its buttoned flap, the braid cord   Looped into the revolver butt.‘Any other root crops?Mangolds? Marrowstems? Anything like that?’   ‘No.’ But was there not a lineOf turnips where the seed ran outIn the potato field? I assumedSmall guilts and satImagining the black hole in the barracks.   He stood up, shifted the baton-caseFarther round on his belt,Closed the domesday book,Fitted his cap back with two hands,   And looked at me as he said goodbye.A shadow bobbed in the window.   He was snapping the carrier spring   Over the ledger. His boot pushed off   And the bicycle ticked, ticked, ticked.3. Orange Drums, Tyrone, 1966The lambeg balloons at his belly, weighsHim back on his haunches, lodging thunderGrossly there between his chin and his knees.   He is raised up by what he buckles under.Each arm extended by a seasoned rod,He parades behind it. And though the drummers   Are granted passage through the nodding crowd,   It is the drums preside, like giant tumours.To every cocked ear, expert in its greed,His battered signature subscribes ‘No Pope’.The goatskin’s sometimes plastered with his blood.   The air is pounding like a stethoscope.4. Summer 1969While the Constabulary covered the mob   Firing into the Falls, I was sufferingOnly the bullying sun of Madrid.Each afternoon, in the casserole heatOf the flat, as I sweated my way through   The life of Joyce, stinks from the fishmarket   Rose like the reek off a flax-dam.At night on the balcony, gules of wine,A sense of children in their dark corners,Old women in black shawls near open windows,   The air a canyon rivering in Spanish.We talked our way home over starlit plains   Where patent leather of the Guardia Civil   Gleamed like fish-bellies in flax-poisoned waters.‘Go back,’ one said, ‘try to touch the people.’   Another conjured Lorca from his hill.We sat through death-counts and bullfight reports   On the television, celebritiesArrived from where the real thing still happened.I retreated to the cool of the Prado.   Goya’s ‘Shootings of the Third of May’   Covered a wall—the thrown-up arms   And spasm of the rebel, the helmeted   And knapsacked military, the efficient   Rake of the fusillade. In the next room,His nightmares, grafted to the palace wall—Dark cyclones, hosting, breaking; Saturn   Jewelled in the blood of his own children,   Gigantic Chaos turning his brute hips   Over the world. Also, that holmgangWhere two berserks club each other to death   For honour’s sake, greaved in a bog, and sinking.He painted with his fists and elbows, flourishedThe stained cape of his heart as history charged.5. Fosterage       for Michael McLaverty‘Description is revelation!’ RoyalAvenue, Belfast, 1962,A Saturday afternoon, glad to meetMe, newly cubbed in language, he gripped   My elbow. ‘Listen. Go your own way.Do your own work. RememberKatherine Mansfield—I will tellHow the laundry basket squeaked",love

"I mean to really live? Kick a spook in the stomach and commit to yourself and not be committed. Sit through another because I got it like that yoga class where a Coldplay soundtrack competes with the upbeat white chick reminding you to be present, to thank yourself for making it to your mat. Point to any place on the map and blow it up. Blow up spots. Why you gotta blow up spots? I loved Lebanon, never quite made it. I spit out the sudden ash with Don Cherry in Marrakech. I lifted one chiseled leg so high over my head Magic City had called and the ATL was ready to blow me up and I said, please. Do I do. What you do. Sing with me. Another shooter made it first and the ACLU was a petty bunch of pseudo-saviors but they blew up spots that one day. So many sad stories you start laughing at the wrong time and you thought yours was one ’til the time working at Ailey with the girl whose mom was killed by her very own daddy in front of the just-say-no rainbow she drew him in class. She wears heavy aquamarine eyeshadow and closes the gap between feeling and being. I’m glad you’re Dorothy Dandridge. Ban on that word, daddy. Banksy sees the zoo in you and cages hisself in bluer notes. I go wild and will, and will. Myth is a special kind of killer and I love her atonal smile. Without her we’d all go bye-bye, point to a place in the rap and make it a black hole, let it suck us in hug the cuckolded sucker emcees and let it hold us against our certain demolition. Without her you would find it hard to live. All the opiates would shrivel into sickle cell and all the blood running through the streets would keep on believing in bodies —  what obsolete machines, the only ones worth saving. Thank yourself for making it     for being present for the cold ache you sit with and rock into situations     for the way you exploded in nuclear winter and thought you had dreamed it     and made a new world bent as your denial     reached forth to caress it all and it shocked your fingertips     this is the bravest numbness",love
"Or a man who looks like him.I only know I call him Daddy(as all southern womendo until the day we die).In my dreams he is still aliveand this is not a comfort.I am my best when tragic.Grief becomes me.Daddy is more real in death,eyes dark, undimmedby the grave, smile less sincere.Matter clings to his thickeyebrows, his mouth spits mudwhen he tries to talk. He is candid.He tells me he liked my sisters better than me.Most times I search for him in a crowdof counterfeit Daddies.I look for pieces of him.An elbow. Black hair on the backof a pale neck. If I find him,I will say, Is that you?I know you this time.",love

If they want to pull they should pull at their own pullables.         So true, said the little girl’s father, people should pull at their own pullables and let other people's pullables alone.

The pathIs slushed with cattle-tracks and fallen timber,The stumps are twisted by the tempests’ wrath.But that I knew these places are my own,I’d ask how came such wretchedness to cumberThe earth, and I to people it alone.It rains across the country I remember.",love

"To the dim light and the large circle of shade I have clomb, and to the whitening of the hills, There where we see no color in the grass. Natheless my longing loses not its green, It has so taken root in the hard stone Which talks and hears as though it were a lady. Utterly frozen is this youthful lady, Even as the snow that lies within the shade; For she is no more moved than is the stone By the sweet season which makes warm the hills And alters them afresh from white to green Covering their sides again with flowers and grass. When on her hair she sets a crown of grass The thought has no more room for other lady, Because she weaves the yellow with the green So well that love sits down there in the shade,– love who has shut me in among low hills Faster than between walls of granite-stone. She is more bright than is a precious stone; The wound she gives may not be healed with grass: I therefore have fled far o’er plains and hills For refuge from so dangerous a lady; But from her sunshine nothing can give shade,– Not any hill, nor wall, nor summer-green. A while ago, I saw her dressed in green,– So fair, she might have wakened in a stone This love which I do feel even for her shade; And therefore, as one woos a graceful lady, I wooed her in a field that was all grass Girdled about with very lofty hills. Yet shall the streams turn back and climb the hills Before love’s flame in this damp wood and green Burn, as it burns within a youthful lady, For my sake, who would sleep away in stone My life, or feed like beasts upon the grass, Only to see her garments cast a shade. How dark soe’er the hills throw out their shade, Under her summer green the beautiful lady Covers it, like a stone cover’d in grass.",love

None of us knew what any of it meant,        but these men spoke sweetly        offering grandmother a roll of baling wire        for each child that went to school.        Before we knew what was happening,        we were sitting in the back of their wagon,        on our way to government school,        away from our families,        to another man’s world.        Often we would cry,        out of loneliness,        but this song helped us        to remember our home.”Get thoughtfully straightenedthe pleats on her skirt,swallowing the last of her coffee.Smiling, she continued . . .        “The government school taught sewing,        I learned on an electric machine.        By the time I returned to the village I could        sew, but few of the people had heard of sewing machines,        or even electricity.        The machine I learned to operate as my trade        could not be carried here and there,        but this song you are learning,        will always be carried in your heart,          here and there.”",fear
"Before I start talking about the movie itself, I would first like to point out that I am big fans of both of the stars involved with this film. Tina Fay is not only a beautiful woman but probably one of the funniest people in Hollywood. She is an amazing writer and I absolutely adore her show ""30 Rock."" As for Steve Carell, he is one of those actors who I really enjoy watching on the big screen and small screen. I have seen almost everything he has done from ""Little Miss Sunshine"" to ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and he has been really good at ""most"" of the roles he has played. With that being said when I saw the trailer for ""Date Night"" I was very excited to see what the end result of the film would be. So when the film finally opened in theaters, I made my journey to my local multiplex and treat myself to a ""Date Night."" ""Date Night"" tells the story of the Fosters who are your typical American family. As part of their normal married routine, once a week Phil (Steve Carell) and Claire (Tina Fay) go out on a date to a local restaurant. One day after spending a night at their friends house, they learn just how mundane and routine marriage can be. After thinking about her own marriage, Claire decides she wants to make next week's date night special. She decides to get all dressed up to surprise Phil. When Phil comes home from work and sees Claire dressed to the nines, he decides that tonight is the night to switch it up for the better. Claire and Phil venture out to the newest Manhattan restaurant on a Friday night without a reservation. Once they get to the restaurant and get denied a table, Phil and Claire pose as ""the Triplehorns"" in order to get seated. While eating they get approached by two goons who think they are ""the Triplehorns."" This is where the fun begins as Phil and Claire's simple date night has turned into a night of mistaken identity and running for their lives from crooked cops and the mob. Lots of laughs and catchy one liners ensue...Steve Carell's performance of Phil Foster was hilarious. He plays a combination of his ""Get Smart"" character and his ""40 Year Old Virgin"" character in the film. I think what makes me enjoy Steve Carell the most is that he seems like a typical down to earth guy. He is never over the top funny or zany guy like say Will Ferrell or Jim Carrey but just comes off like a normal ""nice"" and ""funny"" guy. As for Tina Fay, well she is great here. I think her one-liners were just the best. I don't know if she ad-libbed a lot of them but man she had some great lines. I also feel this role was a bit different from her normal roles, which I liked. While you do see her become ""Liz Lemon"" here at times, you also see a dirtier and different side of Tina Fay here. As for the other roles, there are a lot of famous faces who pop up here and there in the film including a funny appearance by Mark Wahlberg, James Franco, and Mila Kunis just to name a few.Shawn Levy was the man in the director's chair. He is probably best known for directing the ""Night at the Museum"" films. I personally have seen most of Shawn Levy's films and have to admit while he isn't a great director, he is good at what he does. He is really good at creating fun films whether they are geared towards kids or adults. For the most part, I actually enjoy most of the films he directed. I think Mr. Levy knows his limitations and doesn't try to go above and beyond his means, which is a good thing. ""Date Night"" is probably his best film to date to be fair and if nothing else it's definitely his funniest.""Date Night"" was written by Josh Klausner who was the man responsible for writing the dull and lackluster ""Shrek the Third."" Luckily, Mr. Klausner redeemed himself with this film. I thought the dialogue was extremely well written and funny. The situations the two leads were placed in here humorous to say the least. Some of the scenes were just down right hilarious! Without giving too much away, the car scene as well as the strip club scene were two of the best in the film. I think after seeing this film now, I have more hope for ""Shrek Ever After,"" which I was originally dreading to see since the last one was almost unwatchable since it was so dull and boring. But I will have to applaud Mr. Klausner here for writing a fun and enjoyable film.Bottom Line: MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Date Movie"" is a solid 8 out of 10. I admit I had a big smile on my face when I left the theater. ""Date Night"" was one of those movies where I just had a good time watching it. I think if you enjoy the whole ""action/comedy"" genre you will probably get a good kick out of it. If your fans of either Tina Fay or Steve Carell this is definitely a must see for you. I think overall it's a funny little film. It's nothing fresh or original but its definitely something that is brainless fun for 90 mins. Also, be sure to stay for the credits as there are a ton of outtakes during and after the credits, which are very funny.",fear

"It may be through some foreign grace, And unfamiliar charm of face; It may be that across the foamWhich bore her from her childhood’s home, By some strange spell, my Katie brought, Along with English creeds and thought—Entangled in her golden hair—Some English sunshine, warmth, and air! I cannot tell—but here to-day, A thousand billowy leagues away From that green isle whose twilight skiesNo darker are than Katie’s eyes,She seems to me, go where she will, An English girl in England still;I meet her on the dusty street, And daisies spring about her feet;Or, touched to life beneath her tread, An English cowslip lifts its head;And, as to do her grace, rise up The primrose and the buttercup!I roam with her through fields of cane, And seem to stroll an English lane, Which, white with blossoms of the May, Spreads its green carpet in her way! As fancy wills, the path beneath Is golden gorse, or purple heath: And now we hear in woodlands dim Their unarticulated hymn,Now walk through rippling waves of wheat, Now sink in mats of clover sweet, Or see before us from the lawn The lark go up to greet the dawn! All birds that love the English sky Throng round my path when she is by: The blackbird from a neighboring thorn With music brims the cup of morn, And in a thick, melodious rain The mavis pours her mellow strain! But only when my Katie’s voice Makes all the listening woods rejoice I hear—with cheeks that flush and pale—The passion of the nightingale!Anon the pictures round her change, And through an ancient town we range, Whereto the shadowy memory clings Of one of England’s Saxon kings, And which to shrine his fading fame Still keeps his ashes and his name. Quaint houses rise on either hand, But still the airs are fresh and bland, As if their gentle wings caressed Some new-born village of the West. A moment by the Norman tower We pause; it is the Sabbath hour! And o’er the city sinks and swells The chime of old St. Mary’s bells, Which still resound in Katie’s earsAs sweet as when in distant years She heard them peal with jocund din A merry English Christmas in! We pass the abbey’s ruined arch, And statelier grows my Katie’s march, As round her, wearied with the taint Of Transatlantic pine and paint, She sees a thousand tokens cast Of England’s venerable Past! Our reverent footsteps lastly claims The younger chapel of St. James, Which though, as English records run, Not old, had seen full many a sun, Ere to the cold December gale The sullen Pilgrim spread his sail. There Katie in her childish daysSpelt out her prayers and lisped her praise, And doubtless, as her beauty grew, Did much as other maidens do—Across the pews and down the aisle Sent many a beau-bewildering smile, And to subserve her spirit’s need Learned other things beside the creed! There, too, to-day her knee she bows, And by her one whose darker brows Betray the Southern heart that burns Beside her, and which only turns Its thoughts to Heaven in one request, Not all unworthy to be blest, But rising from an earthlier pain Than might beseem a Christian fane. Ah! can the guileless maiden share The wish that lifts that passionate prayer? Is all at peace that breast within? Good angels! warn her of the sin! Alas! what boots it? who can save A willing victim of the wave? Who cleanse a soul that loves its guilt? Or gather wine when wine is spilt?We quit the holy house and gain The open air; then, happy twain, Adown familiar streets we go,And now and then she turns to show, With fears that all is changing fast, Some spot that’s sacred to her Past.Here by this way, through shadows cool,A little maid, she tripped to school; And there each morning used to stop Before a wonder of a shopWhere, built of apples and of pears, Rose pyramids of golden spheres; While, dangling in her dazzled sight, Ripe cherries cast a crimson light, And made her think of elfin lamps, And feast and sport in fairy camps, Whereat, upon her royal throne (Most richly carved in cherry-stone), Titania ruled, in queenly state, The boisterous revels of the fête!’T was yonder, with their “horrid” noise, Dismissed from books, she met the boys, Who, with a barbarous scorn of girls, Glanced slightly at her sunny curls, And laughed and leaped as reckless by As though no pretty face were nigh! But—here the maiden grows demure—Indeed she’s not so very sure, That in a year, or haply twain, Few looked who failed to look again, And sooth to say, I little doubt (Some azure day, the truth will out!) That certain baits in certain eyes Caught many an unsuspecting prize; And somewhere underneath these eaves A budding flirt put forth its leaves!Has not the sky a deeper blue, Have not the trees a greener hue,And bend they not with lordlier graceAnd nobler shapes above the place Where on one cloudless winter morn My Katie to this life was born? Ah, folly! long hath fled the hour When love to sight gave keener power, And lovers looked for special boons In brighter flowers and larger moons. But wave the foliage as it may, And let the sky be ashen gray, Thus much at least a manly youthMay hold—and yet not blush—as truth: If near that blessed spot of earth Which saw the cherished maiden’s birth No softer dews than usual rise, And life there keeps its wonted guise, Yet not the less that spot may seem As lovely as a poet’s dream;And should a fervid faith incline To make thereof a sainted shrine, Who may deny that round us throng A hundred earthly creeds as wrong, But meaner far, which yet unblamed Stalk by us and are not ashamed. So, therefore, Katie, as our stroll Ends at this portal, while you roll Those lustrous eyes to catch each ray That may recall some vanished day,I—let them jeer and laugh who will—Stoop down and kiss the sacred sill!So strongly sometimes on the sense These fancies hold their influence,That in long well-known streets I stray Like one who fears to lose his way. The stranger, I, the native, she,Myself, not Kate, have crossed the sea; And changing place, and mixing times, I walk in unfamiliar climes!These houses, free to every breeze That blows from warm Floridian seas,Assume a massive English air,And close around an English square; While, if I issue from the town, An English hill looks greenly down, Or round me rolls an English park, And in the Broad I hear the Larke! Thus when, where woodland violets hide, I rove with Katie at my side,It scarce would seem amiss to say, “Katie! my home lies far away, Beyond the pathless waste of brine, In a young land of palm and pine! There, by the tropic heats, the soul Is touched as if with living coal, And glows with such a fire as none Can feel beneath a Northern sun, Unless—my Katie’s heart attest!—’T is kindled in an English breast! Such is the land in which I live, And, Katie! such the soul I give. Come! ere another morning beam, We’ll cleave the sea with wings of steam; And soon, despite of storm or calm, Beneath my native groves of palm,Kind friends shall greet, with joy and pride, The Southron and his English bride!”",fear
"Pastfences the first sheepmen cast across the land, processionsof cringing pitch or cedar posts pulling into the vanishingpoint like fretboards carrying barbed melodies, windharpnarratives, songs of place, I’m thinking of the long cowboyballads Ray taught me the beginnings of and would have taught   me the ends if he could have remembered them.

"In true noir-ish fashion, much of the intrigue with The Good German is about to whom, and why, the title applies. For a film that has so much devotion to being a 40s recreation or homage, and in spite of another mesmerising performance from the very talented Cate Blanchett, it is also a mystery as to why it is not more of a runaway success.Employing the grainy black-and-white look of Good Night and Good Luck, only more so, The Good German is a formal exercise in original 40s technique. It uses as its subject 1945 Berlin and the nightmare scenarios of post-war safety. Blanchett plays Lena Brandt, a Jewish German, who attributes her amazing survival to being the ex-wife of an SS man. (She claims he is dead, by the way). Her boyfriend is the violent and abusive Patrick Tully, engagingly played by Tobey Maguire. But haunting her life is also good-guy George Clooney, in the shape of US Captain Jake Geismer. They go back a long way. In more than one sense, to put it delicately. He is disturbed to see her turning tricks as much as he is to see her hanging out with a low-life like Tully.Lena wants to get out of Berlin, but that is easier said than done. Our film is awash with intrigues as everyone individually tries to help her, but everyone also schemes against each other. Who is a war criminal and who is just an ordinary German? Understandably, no-one wants to be caught with their pants down, and everybody is in Lena's.Lena herself plays her cards very close to her chest. She only reveals her hand towards the end. As she takes over centre-stage, her story provides some tension and emotional ballast to a plot that is otherwise a bit lifeless. Disappointingly, the usually capable Clooney is the weak link in the acting. His usually charismatically chirpy, cheeky style seems anachronistic and makes him look both typecast and mis-cast. The part could have been written for Humphrey Bogart. There and many thematic and visual references to Casablanca. But Clooney's lack of gravitas highlights the film's stylistic weakness. The Good German is ponderous without conveying a seriousness of the subject matter and so ends up just seeming self-important.Beautiful noir-ish chiaroscuro lighting is a delicious hearkening back to more substantial classics of old. But, with the exception of Lena, the characters lack the moral ambiguity that was so characteristic of such films. Jake mentions, ""the good old days - when you could tell who was the bad guy by who was shooting at you."" But, although the line could have come out of the mouth of Bogart, it refers to a period and style of film-making that is a world away from what this tries to be.Lena (Cate Blanchett) is a mystery, and the film is worth seeing for this magnificent, towering performance, that is also a study in emotional complexity. Long-suffering, she oozes oceans of repressed emotion in a way to make Ingrid Bergman proud. Although more complex than female protagonists of 40s movies, she is still the most successful part of the whole homage.The story does have a little more subtlety than one might have expected, but I find it hard to imagine vast audiences wading through it joyfully until the pace eventually picks up enough to warrant serious interest. It's good to see the usually very capable Steven Soderbergh directing serious cinema again (instead of his Ocean's Eleven romps) but this over-ambitious project doesn't quite cut it. See it if you're a fan of Blanchett, or if you enjoy seeing Clooney getting beaten up.",fear
"Plot Outline: Schoolgirl Lucky (Sneha Ullal) and Indian Ambassador in Russia's son Aditya (Salman Khan) meet by accident in what turns out to be one of the most risky days of their lives as they battle insurgency in finding their way back home to safety.Comment: The Russian locales such as the buildings in St. Petersburg, the graveyard, the train and snow make the movie look like a fairy tale. The story is predictable and the twists get funny at times. When I first saw the promos with Sallu carrying a lifeless and expressionless Sneha and the sub-title ""No time for love"", I thought that that the movie is love story with a terminally ill girl. Thankfully, this is not the story anyways.Salman acts his age and looks decent. Newcomer and much publicized Ash-look-alike Sneha looks sweet but devoid of life. Hope Sneha's next movie will put some life in her. Mithun Chakraborthy is a sad bondage to the movie. Adnan Sami's music is fresh and 'Lucky Lips' is a must for your mp3 player.Rating: 2/5  Watch out for newcomer Sneha and Adnan's music.",fear
"There are very few films I've come across which actually make you want to beat yourself senseless with a heavy object. But this is surely one of them. Quite possibly one of the worst films ever made and I can't believe I managed to watch it through to the end! Twice. Once in the cinema and once on TV!First off let me say that I can understand the need to make a compromise between historical accuracy and the telling of a 'good story'. That assumes of course that you have a good story to tell, rather than this banal boiling-pot of the oldest clichés in the book.The heights of implausibility which this film manages to attain are just jaw-dropping. Saving Private Ryan managed to interweave an implausible story with historical events while maintaining a semblance of believability. Pearl Harbor just had me swearing obscenities at the screen in frustration! I can forgive the use of late-model Spitfires in the 'Battle of Britain' sequences. What is less forgivable is the portrayal of the Battle of Britain at all given that it took place in 1940 and not 1941 as depicted here! And it is never quite explained how Ben Afleck manages to get himself released from his duties with the RAF and return to Hawaii - I guess he decided he'd had enough and so handed back his plane and uniform! Isn't that desertion in most people's book? Some of the special effects during the attack on Pearl Harbor are, admittedly, not bad - despite the appearance of what appear to be quite modern warships in some shots! But the makers seem to think that the more special effects they can get into a single frame of film then the more realistic/impressive it will be! Unfortunately it just ends up looking like an intro-sequence for a Medal of Honor type game. Less is definitely more sometimes! Talking about effects - what was that all about with the sequences in the hospital during the battle? Did they get a dud batch of film stock that had been exposed to sunlight or something? It's all very well trying to be smart with film effects but sometimes you can end up looking like complete amateurs - which I'm afraid they do here.As for our intrepid heroes suddenly becoming experienced B-25 pilots - oh pur-lease!! At this point I had my head in my hands and was sobbing uncontrollably. The boys even manage to get involved in hand-to-hand combat, wiping out an entire Japanese platoon in the process. Presumably this was to show that our heroes were capable of going toe-to-toe with the enemy as well as just dropping bombs on them? Who on earth was this film aimed at? I'm sure the majority of filmgoers are not complete imbeciles but this is exactly who the target audience seems to be. It could be viewed simply as a romantic adventure yarn (although the romantic element is dire) but it seems to want to portray itself as much more than that, which is it's biggest weakness. If you want to be a heavy-weight historical drama then you just cannot mix in the sort of love-triangle claptrap and implausible plot lines that are in this.Dreadful. Watch it and cringe.",fear

"Ostrich and Lark started each morning togetherat first light,day in and day out. And they partedat nightfall. Every day they nibbled an ongoing meal:a few seeds here,a few seeds there;for Ostrich, the occasional lizard. All day the sun glared out of cloudless blue. Every day, all day,over the cidada’s drone,a drizzle of buzzings fell,and a downpour of birdsong. Hornbill, Bee-eater, Hoopoe, Diederik,Mousebird, Whydah, Canary:from gray-light-come to last-light-gone,the fancy-dressed suitors of the veldwarbled their rain-shower jazz. But Ostrich was silent. Lark sang the first song of the day,perched tall, slender, the tawny brownon a termite castleor a low branch of a camel thorn tree. But Ostrich was silent. When Lark sang,he flickered his wings,and his white throat feathers trembled.All day Lark sang, standing still or flitting,his open wings vermillion-spangled. But Ostrich was silent. At dusk Lark sought his hidden nest on the ground. Ostrich sat downunder an acacia treeand tucked his headunder one of his black-and-white wings. Sometimes he dreamed of flying.Sometimes he dreamed of singing the sky full of stars. Sometimes he dreamedof the green season, drinkingcaught water, and drinking, and drinking.

One evening,as the great red sunsank toward the tree-spiked horizonand the birds swooped to their nests;as the plant eaters gathered at full alertand the meat eaters woke to prowl;as the gates of night opened to the dark, Ostrich fluttered his billowy wings.He stretched his graceful neck,closed his eyes, andTWOO-WOO-WOOOT Ostrich found his voice,a voice part lion’s roar,part foghorn,part old man trumpeting into his handkerchief.

Ostrich boomed like the promiseof jubilant green, like the promise of birth. Ostrich boomed Lark right off his perch! Lark flew up to anOstrich-high branchand looked at his friendwith a big WOW in his eyes. Ostrich had found his voice at last,his own beauty,his big, terrific self.",fear

"""Vampire in Brooklyn"" is probably one of Wes Craven's most underappreciated movies, and that for some weird reasons.
Eddie Murphy and Angela Bassett are great together and really got a great chemistry (cf: the dance scene)It got some chilling moments (Rita's dreams, Nikki's death, the final...)The musical score from Craven's old collaborator, J Peter Robinson, is great.The humor especially from John Witherspoon and Kadeem Hardison is hilarious.ANGELA BASSETT ! OH MY GOD ! ANGELA BASSETT ! She's the best on that movie.I think the movie is entertaining. It's not Craven's best movie for sure but it's probably one of his most fun.",fear
"This movie really suffered from the over exposure of ""Beniffer"". Never in the history of motion pictures has a film been dead in the water before it ever made it to the big screen. Critiques were waiting to trash this film. Had it turned out to be the second coming of ""Gone With the Wind,"" they still would have trashed it. Fans, feeding off the negativity, trounced it as well. It never had a chance. Now that some time has passed and it can be looked at without the animosity and preconceived hatred of Ben and Jen, I think Gigli stands up pretty well. Let me say, at the time, I was not particularly a fan of Ben Affleck, nor was I then or currently a fan of J-Lo's singing or acting. I just thought the movie had a nice story, some funny dialog, and actually deserved better than it got from fans. For those who do not know, Affleck is Gigli, a wannabe mob stooge who is given the task of kidnapping Brian, the retarded brother of a government witness. Enter, Ricki, a lesbian assassin who is hired to ride herd on Gigli so he does not screw up. Gigli starts to fall for Ricki and she, despite her orientation, feels something special for him as well. The byplay between Affleck and Lopez is funny and its obvious they have chemistry (even if they eventually broke up). J-Lo's yoga routine alone is reason to own this movie. If there is a better explanation (and visual) of the difference between the male and female genitalia than the one J-Lo espouses while stretching in spandex, I have not seen or heard it. Justin Bartha (later to gain fame as Riley in the ""National Treasure"" movies) gives a pretty impressive performance as the mentally-challenged Brian. My biggest issue with this movie is the inclusion of Al Pacino as a gangster (talk about stretching yourself as an actor) At some point in his career, someone told Pacino that acting entails slowly raising his voice until he is railing at the top of his lungs. That's all he does in his movies. He just escalates his tone. That's not acting. That's a recipe for an ulcer. This movie is not going to change your life, but its also not going to end it. See it without the baggage of petty critics and People Magazine-influenced movie goers.",fear
"It is always defended remake should not be compared with the original,..but it is hard to avoid. That's why I need to comment on both the movies. In Bollywood there were numerous movies made based on reincarnation such as Kudrat (1981), Karan Arjun, Hamesha, Prem or recent like Om Shanti Om.Satish Kaushik is back again with this reincarnation tale after his 1995's Prem which was also based on 'punar janam'. Compulsarily I have to mention about the casting which is not satisfactory at all. The casting is quite poor and if we target the movie with reality it stands nowhere to a standard movie. Here are the reasons. First is casting of Himesh as the leading role Monty, which was performed by Rishi Kapoor in the original, does not ignite much to watch it. As it was spread the news that Ranbir would have been a better choice if he was offered to reprise his dad's evergreen role in this modern version of reincarnation story Karzzzz. Still then arguably Himesh's role is arranged with the exception of today's audiences, and finally did his own justified role as much as he could. Secondly, debutante actress Shweta Kumar, who is given to reprise the role originally performed by Tina Munim. She has nothing qualities to be described as an actress of Bollywood, even though she is a daughter of memorable director Indra Kumar. Besides, she has no sense of acting or speaking accent and has a long way to improve herself to be listed in A grade actresses. Third and final weakness is with Danny Denzongpa who parts as Kabira, a Muslim addicted with olden Bollywood dialogues. Although his role is interesting and performed his best here but he actually doesn't look like a Muslim at all. Shouldn't it be justified with reality?The movie is at its peak point only when Monty (Himesh) meets vamp Princess Kamini (Urmila) and the thrilling romances between them flow forward. It was an exciting to see them together and challenging for one another. But here again something looks fake between the ageing of Himesh and Urmila with their role. Urmila doesn't suit with the role as a senior woman than Himesh, with whom the latter dates even. It has no sense at all if it is compared with Simi Garewal and Rishi Kapoor, which was far more acceptable. The remaining casts were incapable of making the story hit except Dino Morea who has a short cameo role for about 10 minutes and later sometimes sparking out with past memories.The songs are also average, and only best for Himesh's personal fans but not beyond that. Himesh improved his acting and body languages a lots after his first Aap Ka Suroor, but only weakness with the remake story. Om Shanti Om was based on with many references from Karz but it was superb in itself and Shahrukh did almost a comparable performance with Rishi Kapoor.Still then original are always best than the remakes, and same is the case between Karz and Karzzzz.",fear

The theme is both the environment and health. What is not so clear is why he, in his role of actor and executive producer, accepted the script with its awful dialogue and clichéd situations.This is a tough one to say good things about, Connery, again with his ponytailed wig, remains as watchable as always, but this really is not two of his better hours.

"Morgan is a genetically engineered human being, of sorts. It could be argued she is artificial intelligence as her development is augmented by a little nano cell that works it's way in and changes her genetic make-up. She is the third experiment, and the first to grow to full term, and as such her scientists and handlers have grown attached to her like parents. Unfortunately there's an incident that leaves one of her handlers without an eye, so the business that funds the research and development send in their ""Risk Management Consultant"" to evaluate the situation and ensure any necessary measures are enacted.The film spends a little time developing it's characters and the situation, but the second and third acts are almost indistinguishable as it cascades at break-neck speed to it's conclusion, giving the film a feeling of being rushed along. The development we do get is a little lacklustre as well, maybe in large part due to not being given enough time. Once everything kicks off, it becomes a display of smart people being stupid, meaningless deaths, and a cat and mouse chase between Lee and Morgan. There's no deeper subtext or message here either, which makes this low-key sci-fi feel a bit empty. All the ingredients are there for a deep and engaging commentary on artificial intelligence or corporate interference or familial relationships, but all of these things are just lightly touched upon and never developed.Despite this, what it does touch upon does enough to make you empathise with the scientists, particularly Amy, the behaviourist, and Dr. Ziegler, who have grown most attached to their subject. There's also mention of romantic relationships developing between doctors Darren and Brenda Finch, and them considering Morgan their child, although Darren is the only one of the two who really shows much of an attachment at all. In a way, all the stupid decisions of these scientists could be explained as being blinded by love for their creation. No-one wants to harm their children, and being cruel to be kind is tough, but this doesn't really excuse the lack of common sense displayed.The film's biggest sin was showing far too much in the trailers. Almost all the development is succinctly summarised in those two minutes, and most of the action is spoiled as well. For instance, Morgan goes into the house and says she has to say goodbye to Mother, referring to Dr. Cheng, but we already know the outcome of that from the trailer. Similarly, Lee and Morgan are chasing each other in cars down a country lane and bashing into each other, but we already saw Lee's Mercedes crash into a tree in the trailer, so again we already know the result of that conflict. I don't want to start avoiding trailers for movies, because I still think they're the best judge of a movie's potential, and I tend to treat them with a grain of salt anyway due to how they can be misrepresented, but Morgan makes me rethink that stance.That said, there are still a number of surprises in store, not least the big twist at the end. Yes, there's a twist at the end that encourages you to rethink the whole ninety minutes previously. Unfortunately it ultimately falls flat. First and foremost, it's not exactly a hidden twist. It's not spelled out throughout the movie, but what subtle hints we did get were enough to put the puzzle pieces together. I pegged it somewhere around the second act. Secondly, it just leaves the ending open to more questions while ignoring that this might be a problem. 'Here's a twist, Oh yeah! Wow! Credits...Wait, how does that work exactly?' I don't want to spoil it, but you'll know what I mean when you see it for yourself.Acting is actually pretty great though. The obvious star of the movie is Anya Taylor-Joy who manages to balance the emotional innocence of Morgan with her somewhat artificial nature without over-doing one or the other. She's obviously not human, even when exhibiting human emotions, but she doesn't appear to force it or look awkward doing it either. Kate Mara is quite good as the cold and somewhat emotionless Risk Management Consultant, Lee. But for me, it was Toby Jones as Dr. Ziegler and Rose Leslie as Amy who really shone and acted as great supports for Anya. It's the acting performances of Jones and Leslie that gives these characters so much development and eeks sympathy from the audience. Brian Cox, Michelle Yeoh, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Paul Giamatti and the rest of the cast all do really well as well, but aren't really given much opportunity to dig into their characters and show us who they are. Cox and Giamatti in particular are just glorified cameos.Don't get me wrong, you could do worse than Morgan when picking a movie to watch, and I am definitely glad I watched it. It's teeming with potential that is just never fully realised. On it's own terms, as a tight thriller of a genetically engineered human seeing red, it is quite entertaining, and it's lack of depth allows the audience to just sit back and enjoy the ride. I enjoyed it, but it's far from anything special. I give it a good 7/10.",fear

"There isn't much to be said about Virgin Suicides, yes, the performance from the cast was good, the sound track was good, and the cinematography had nice touches here and there but the rest of the film was poor.Although the cast give very good performances, you are unable to immerse yourself in any of the characters, this is because the entire life of the girls is portrayed by the boys so we don't get to really know the girls characters, and whilst the boys are so busy telling us about the girls we don't get to understand their characters either.  The film comes across as being more a 'sequence of events' or 'this is what happened' rather than a 'movie'.  Perhaps this is because of the way it has been lifted from the original novel, that said, I haven't read the book so is it just as bad?There have been certain criticisms from IMDB users aimed towards people who didn't seem to 'get it', there is nothing to get, try as you might to read into it more, there is no opening anywhere to read into it, no hidden meaning or message, no twist, nothing, it doesn't even really try to make a point.

"There seems to be a consensus, in all the books on films noir that I've come across, that ""Out of the Past"" is a pretty fine, not to say iconic, example of the genre. I bought it a few years ago and was not impressed. However, after having read some more stuff recently and been encouraged once again by a host of positive opinions, I watched it again. Well, still no dice. I'm not even convinced that it's a particularly good film, never mind a classic example of noir. The major problem is the script. While memorably snappy here and there (""Baby, I don't care""; ""A dame with a rod is like a guy with a knitting needle""; ""Awfully cold around the heart""; and Bailey's voice-over in the flashback), it loses focus and momentum in the last third of the film, the San Francisco/Tahoe scenes. Here the film is complicated by needlessly tortuous plotting, and Kathie's villainy seems awkward and dull.The San Francisco scenes are the most noir-ish in terms of style and setting. Set at night, in the rain, there are long moments of quiet as Bailey sidles in and out of bars and apartments. Yet the photography is unremarkable and adds nothing to the mood of the piece that the night-time does not bring on its own. This contrasts starkly with the opening of the film, set in daylight in mid-town America, by the fishing stream, and with the second third of the film, set in Acapulco, in the sunshine and brightness, and the romance of the beach. Yet there is a standard noir voice-over against the sunshine which, though it doesn't jibe with the intense romance that plays out there, is no doubt intended to underscore Bailey's fatalism and Kathie's projected betrayal. The tone is so uneven that the mood of the film, intentionally cynical and bleak, simply drains away into a dullness that is only reprieved by the out-and-out nihilism of the ending.And yet there is some good stuff too. The flashback sequence is probably the best in the film, despite the asymmetry of its components. In fact, perhaps this very conflict of styles brings a complexity and depth that the rest of the film sadly lacks. Bailey's utter abandonment of his better self to Kathie, punctuated by his wonderfully poetic narrative, gives heart to a film that sorely lacks one. The pain and shock on Bailey's face when Kathie shoots Fisher dead, is mirrored in the viewer's. After this, nothing matters and no-one cares  it just slides away into tedium.The performances are very varied. I am conflicted by Mitchum's. Much as I value him as an actor, his laconic, careless mannerisms are reduced to weariness in this film; his resignation approaches enervation. There is nothing at all convincing about his feelings for the character of Anne Miller, and though Bailey belongs entirely to the milieu of Kathie and her sociopathic impulses, one cannot feel any sympathy for him, as he feels nothing for himself. All is emptiness.While there is at least a seamless effortlessness about Mitchum, the same cannot be said of Jane Greer. She is fundamentally without charm as a seductress and unconvincing as a femme fatale. When compared to Barbara Stanwyck as Phyllis Dietrichson, or even Gene Tierney as Ellen Berent, her shortcomings are glaring. As an actress she reacts to the role instead of making it her own.The only real bright spot in the film was Kirk Douglas, to be honest. Whit Sterling really thrived. Whether venal, cool, angry, amused or simply smooth, he managed to evince a real passion for life and, alone of all the characters in the film, laughed. Whit suddenly slapping Kathie was the only time I felt anything as the film dragged to a close.Noir cynicism and suffering are one thing (""In a Lonely Place"", for example), but lifelessness is something else again. ""Out of the Past"" is mired in the sense of its own meaninglessness. It is beyond loneliness, beyond bitterness. This is not film noir. This is boredom.",fear

"This film desperately wants to be the new ""Chinatown""--a stylish noir murder mystery that unmasks secrets of individuals and governments. They even name Clooney's character ""Jake"" (Jake Gittes was the detective in ""Chinatown"")Despite the use of black and white, 1940's lenses, old style music, old style framing and integrated footage from 1945 Berlin shot by Frank Capra among others, ""The Good German"" is a failure, but a good attempt.Clooney seems to be walking through his part as the film's star, a war correspondent who's in Berlin to cover the Potsdam conference but is actually just looking for his old girlfriend. He's no Bogart. Toby McGuire is shrill and hard to watch as his crooked driver who's involved in the black market. As far as Kate Blanchett goes, I just don't get it. She's a fine actress and all, but is not the kind of Ingrid Bergman-esquire beauty (or even Faye Dunaway in ""Chinatown"") I think this film required. People who hate Clooney (I don't) might like ""the Good German"" for the fact he gets beat up not once, not twice but three times in this film (once even by the tiny McGuire!) while others might like the attempt at giving this film an old time look.

"This film tries to do it all: adventure, comedy, and romance. Romancing the Stone succeeds, but Crocodile Dundee and other films have done it better. Kathleen Turner stars as romance novelist Joan Wilder, a city girl who unintentionally finds herself stranded in the Colombian wilderness, miles away from modern communication and transportation. She encounters her opposite, a rugged outdoorsy soldier of fortune named Jack. Their clashing personalities are fun to watch. Of course, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom presented a similar relationship and did it better, but let's give Romancing the Stone credit for doing it first (by a few months). Good cast. Danny DeVito is especially entertaining. I liked how Joan's experiences transform her character. Good plot premise. But parts of the script are a bit sloppy. The story moves forward at a good pace, but the progress of the story relies too often on ""coincidences."" (Imagine if you read a Superman story where every time Superman is about to catch the bad guy, a piece of kryptonite falls from the sky and knocks him unconscious.)I was shocked that this film was nominated for best editing. In some getaway scenes, the editors apparently cut the part where the hiding party realizes that their pursuers have just arrived. The editors simply cut to the shot where the hiding party is attempting their escape. Fixing this problem would have extended the film's runtime by about 10 seconds. Also, there are some goofs involving stunt doubles, one of which could have been fixed by simply cutting the shot a second earlier.I was disappointed that we never learn the history of the treasure or the map. Nor do we learn how or why Elaine's husband acquired the map or why he was in Colombia in the first place.Despite its flaws, this movie is fun. Check it out if you enjoy adventure flicks.",fear

Suddenly there's two of everyone, which apparently causes violence to ensue. In the midst of it all, the main character is trying to win back his girlfriend. Is it sci-fi? Horror? Drama?

A bunch of one-dimensional characters try to say deep things once in a while, and their reactions to the strange situation are a little contrived, as if the writers chose to force a horror/thriller show from a premise that should've taken a more intriguing route. I also kept wondering why everyone didn't just LEAVE when it became apparent that things weren't right. I guess the party was just that good.It turned out fun, somewhat entertaining, and a bit disturbing, but could've been more. I'd recommend this for a streaming rainy day view.",fear

"The first thing that stood out for me in the movie is the absolute scale of most of the shots, thousands of penguins dancing, with it all feeling natural instead of it looking like a giant copy and paste operation with a bunch of a cloudy and blurry wiggles all over the screen. The penguins seamlessly transform from the documentary penguin visuals we are accustomed to, to the talking penguins. Visually and technically, it's a marvel and the ticket price is worth it for that alone.The first Happy Feet was five years ago and I remember it having a lighthearted feel to it. This new Happy Feet Two movie starts with a foreboding view of earth from space where the ice shelves are cracking off from the south pole. It then moves to a penguin dance to the song ""Rhythm Nation"" that is almost a military march and then to our our new baby penguin protagonist Erik, who is unable to both sing or dance. Gone are the themes of heart-songs and tap dancing. The south pole has become a dangerous ice jungle with calamities and predators at every corner. The themes have changed from individualistic to the nationalistic, the characters from didactic to the cautionary. I think adults will enjoy this change of tone but I don't know how kids will feel about the new dark and non-individualistic themes.The most jarring aspect of the movie is the accents. Some characters have neutral American accents while some have African-American stylings. Sea-elephants have British accents as do some penguins. A different nation of penguins all have Spanish accents. I don't know if there is a method behind all these accents but I can't help but imagine an underlying social or political commentary in the story. Or, it could just be my imagination.Overall, it's a great movie and I suggest you definitely go see it. The ticket price is worth it for the visuals alone. The engaging story and the great singing are just bonus value.",fear

"For some reason the first 15 minutes of this movie are the biggest cliche in movie history.

Otherwise it's predictibe, acting is bad (even for Dennis Quaid who is usually amazing) and there's scenes that don't make any sense.

"""Killing Me Softly"" has one of those scripts that just don't give the audience a break - not only does it set up an improbable situation, but the big ""twist"" at the end is also mind-numbingly predictable (unless perhaps you haven't seen a thriller before in your life). The chemistry between the two leads is also lacking; Fiennes brings some physical magnetism to his role but as far as his acting is concerned, he's an inexpressive bloke, while Heather Graham is ALL TOO expressive - she overemphasizes every emotion her character is supposed to feeling by making faces at the camera. Besides, she's not even that attractive; even her co-star in this particular film, Natascha McElhone, blows her out of the water in that department. In spite of all that, Chen Kaige's direction is good, and he creates some suspenseful moments. So I give the film a generous ""** out of 4"" rating.",fear

"We've seen dramatic and extreme post-apocalyptic thrillers almost as many times as we've survived the Rapture, and it is hard to imagine that anyone can interpret the theme in a way that would make a movie more enjoyable. However, none of the previous films starred Steve Carrell or stayed completely in the pre-apocalyptic world. As it turns out, these two facts make a huge difference.Dodge (Carrell) learns that nothing can be done to prevent the imminent destruction of the world while in the car with his wife, Linda (Nancy Carrell, formerly Nancy Walls and hilarious without saying a word). Linda then literally runs away, and so begins the story of Dodge's terrible misfortune. He is a modern-day adult version of Charlie Brown – likable, but not extraordinary in any sense except for his ability to attract sadness. Seeking then shows how everyone else is coping with the news, and Dodge doesn't seem very interested in surfing, sex, or suicide, so he just meanders through the madness sipping his cough syrup. He probably would have done that for the entire three weeks left of his life were it not for a his neighbor Penny (Keira Knightley), a flighty girl trying to get a flight back to her family in England. The two escape a riot (and Penny's loser boyfriend, perfectly played by Adam Brody) and set out on an adventure so that Dodge can say goodbye to his high school sweetheart and Penny can get to England by way of Dodge's friend who owns a plane.The commercials portray this film as more of a comedy, and it is delightfully funny in some spots, but this film is far more emotionally and intellectually stimulating than it is amusing. I remember thinking at the end of 2005's War of the Worlds, ""I wish they had spent more time focusing on humanity."" The human experience of facing the end of life is so complex and so unique to every individual, and Director Loren Scafaria succeeds in showing the despair, decadence, and delusions that people would definitely be wrapped up in were this to occur in real life.Carrell is brilliant as usual with his effortless self-effacing humor. He seems to have worked on his deadpan skills as his funniest moments include reacting to crazy events with a blank stare or monotone comment. Knightley manages to be an effervescent and bubbly realist without being annoying, which makes Penny a completely plausible running buddy for Dodge, who can't take much more agitation. These two stars have a chemistry that allows Dodge to come out of his shell and live the last days of his life the way he wished he had lived all along. A few people live in less inspiring ways to awesome comedic effect. Elsa, Dodge's housekeeper, still diligently comes to clean his house and even instructs him to get more ""Windows"" while shaking a nearly empty bottle of glass cleaner. Warren (fellow Daily Show alum Rob Corddry) celebrates the end of responsibility by boozing it up and sharing his drinks freely, even with little kids. These scenes, however, are merely distractions from how Dodge and Penny learn more than they ever imagined about life and the world simply because it is all coming to an end. Despite the hokey-ness, I must admit that I got teary-eyed as the characters realized what matters most.Focus Features does a great job of producing equally thought-provoking and heartstring-pulling films and Seeking is no exception. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and with any luck, you'll leave the theater thankful that you most likely have more than three weeks to make the most of your life.",fear

"Parc Georges-Brassens, ParisMost afternoons, I’d run laps through Parc Brassens   where grows the second smallest vineyard   I have ever seen, and where those silver,   pruned-back stalks looked blunt,   strung-out on wires, and mostly dead   all winter. That was how I saw them.   That’s all I expected. Even in the cold,   I’d see a guy my age there, once a week,   playing his guitar. He’d sit next to the bench   where I’d be stretching. He rarely spoke—   just to ask if I’d like a song—   until the week before I left for good.   I was sitting at the top of a hill   about a hundred feet away from where   if you stand tiptoe you can see the Eiffel Tower.   He sat too close to me. We spoke of many things.   Then he suggested we go at it right there,   on the ground, under the sun. This is how   one lives who knows that she will die:   rolling in the arms of anyone when she can—   rolling in the arms of a musician—aware   that no one cares much what we do in little knolls behind reedy forsythia,   in the middle of a Tuesday, in the middle   of living. And I would know now   how he felt, and the ground against me,   and whether he was rough or sweet.   And what is possible would widen every hour.   Oh, but me, I thought I was immortal.",fear

"“painting has no air . . .”          —Gertrude SteinThat there should never be airin a picture surprises me.It would seem to be only a pictureof a certain kind, a portrait in paperor glue, somewhere a stickinessas opposed to a stick-to-it-nessof another genre. It might bequite new to do withoutthat air, or to find oxygenon the landscape linelike a boat which is an objector a shoe which never floatsand is stationary.

"1.Look here, Marcus Aurelius, we’ve come to seeyour temple, deluded the guards, crawled through a holein the fence. Why your descendent, my guide and friendhas opted for secrecy, I don’t know. But I do knowwhat to call the Africans, passport-less, yellow-eyedwho will ride the boat before me for Naples, they hope.Here the sea curls its granite lip at them and flings a winterstorm like a cough, or the seadog drops them at Hannibal’sshores, where they’ll stand stupefied like his elephants.What dimension of time will they cross at the Hours looptight plastic ropes round their ankles and wrists?What siren song will the trucks shipping them backto Ouagadougou drone into their ears? I look at themloitering, waiting for the second act of their darknessto fall. I look at the sky shake her dicey fists.One can be thankful, I suppose, for not being one of them,and wrap the fabric of that thought around oneselfto keep the cold wind at bay. But what world is thisthat makes our lives sufficient even as the horizon’s ropeis about to snap, while the sea and sky ache to becomean open-ended road? That’s what we’re all waiting for,a moment to peel itself like skin off fruit, and let us inon its sweetness as we wait, smoking, or fondling provisions,listening the engine’s invocational purr. In an hourthat will dawn and dusk at once, one that will stretchinto days strung like beads on the horizon’s throat,they will ride their tormented ship as the dog starbegins to float on the water, so bright and still,you’d want to scoop it out in the palm of your hand.2.A pair of Roman fists robbed of spear and shield;the tiles of the tapestries mixed in with popcornthat slipped from the buttery hands, aluminumwrappers smudged with processed cheese;countless cigarette butts surround the fallencolumns and beams with a fringe of tarnished foam;pairs of panties still hot with forbidden passion…The ruins are not ruined.                                   Without all this garbagepacked, stratified, how else to name our age?3.Earlier, I had walked the market of Sabratha, changedto its people, but like my old city brought me back to me.The petty merchants, all selling the same goods, shouted outjokes to each other. A Sudanese waiter carried a traywith a giant pot of green tea with mint. Among the older men,their heads capped with crimson shennas, I kept seekingmy father’s face. An old lust wafted past me when the abaya-cladwomen, scented with knock-off Chanel, sashayed by.The sawdust floors of the shawarma and falafel eateries,the sandwich maker dabbing insides of loaveswith spoons of searing harissa, my mouth wateringto a childhood burn. Pyramids of local oranges,late season pomegranates, radish and turnip bulbsstacked like billiard balls, and the half carcasses of lambsas if made of wax and about to melt off their hooks,the trays of hearts, kidneys, brains and testicles arrayedin slick arabesques. The hand-woven rugs wherethe extinct mouflon thrives, mincers, hairdryers, and toasters,their cords tentacles drooping from rusty shelves.It was as if my eyes were painting, not seeing, what I saw,my memory slowly building the scene until it assembled whole.What face did my face put on in the midst of transfiguration?I know what the eyes of the men my age said, settled nowin comfortable middle age, about the life I left behind.True, I did envy them the asceticism of their grace,where a given horizon becomes a birthright—to drive or walkpast the same hills all your life, to eat from the same treeand drink from the well that gave you your name.4.Though for centuries the locals broke the statues’limbs and ground them to make primitive pottery,enough remains to echo all that has disappeared:you and the woman leave the towpath, and you brace heragainst the trunk of an oak. It’s not the moonlight, but refractionsfrom suburban homes trapped under cloud-coverthat make her bronze skin glow among glistening trees.First, God made love:                            the canopy like the inside of an emerald,her lips a rush of cochineal. Then a route of evanescencebrought her from Carthage into these living arms, here.5.“A nice time, “ he tells us, how he and fourcousins crossed the desert heading homeon top of three-years’ worth of meager pay(the tarp ballooning, a giant dough) roped to a truck.Wearing the goggles of the welder he'd hopedto become, he looked at the sky and wondered “whatthose flying, smoke on their tails, thought of us.”Later, deported in a cargo plane, he handedthe Tuareg soldiers one of his fake passports,and they like “space aliens” (in shabby uniforms,sunglasses, tribal veils) poured into his face.As the propellers’ hammering calmed toa shuddering hum, he saw the stars, “hundredsof them like gnats” swarm Mt. Akakous’ peak.“My next road is the water,” he says servingus tonight, and we promise, if the coffee is good,to put him on the next boat to the moon                                                shining over Syracuse.6.Suddenly, I find your descendant’s hands leafing throughmy chapters, scribbling a note in the margin of my thoughts:            “How is it,” he asks, “that starlight announces the hour:             how can a song divide desire in two?”“My flame,” I must have written or said, “coated her bodylike silk, one kiss spreading threads of lighteninginto her pores, until she became a sob, barely lifted by the wind,and I became mist, the shadow of a statue at the break of dawn.”             To that he responds, “a Platonic echo;” and             “What will come of such a plasticine love?”Marcus Aurelius, your descendent knows I’ll leaveas I arrive, so empty he gets lost in me.7.Two centuries ago, one of my ancestors saton one of the communal latrines in mid-morningand listened to Apuleius’s defense. Across from himon that marble hexagon, sat two other men.On normal days they’d have talked about the olive harvest,the feast of Venus coming soon. But today they listen tothe Madaurian’s high eloquence studded with jokes,cracking their own one-liners, shaking their heads in delight.Away from the hot midday sun and the throngs,you could say, they had the best seats in the house,and so they lingered and heard as much as they couldthen went about their business. So what if a man mariesan older woman for her money, what impoverished young Romanin his right mind wouldn’t do that? And sure too, if some mancomes to take your inheritance, even if he’s your best friend,even if he takes good care of your mother, you’d be a foolnot to sue him to the Council, even if you’d have to accuse himfalsely of black magic. That’s the beauty of it, or rather,whoever is going to win will have to make us trust beauty,that things being already right, can be more right, whichis what “beautiful” really means. And what better way,to take in all this refinement than hearing it in a latrinewhere only beauty shields you from the awful stuff of life.8.Marcus Aurelius, the men at the shore follow your pathinto eternity, though they already see their journeyas a quarrel with circumstance, their lives abscesses feedingon the universe’s hide, tumors in detention camps,in basement kitchens. Their pockets filled with drachmas,they’ll lift diffident heads and drag feet lead-heavy with shame.One of them is now driving a taxi in Thessaloniki or Perugia.With enough of the language to understand direction, he engageshis late night passengers. In the light of the dashboardthey’ll entrust him with their secrets. With time, he’ll becomea light unto himself, his car a winged chariot of human folly,and his responses to them saplings nourished in the darksoil of philosophy. It’s the gift of seasons that strayfrom the earth, when soul reigns incidental to flesh,forgiving to no end, a light that has long surpassed itself.9.The birds that drew the line to the first distanceremain nameless to me—creamy white breasts, gold dust around their eyes,black/brown (dark roast) wings.The deserts they crossed, the plains eastor north of here fall like sand from my hands.Um Bsisi, I want to call them, citizens of a protracted destiny,native and stranger, prodigal and peasant—admit now, they you’re none of these,that you’re not any,                        or even all of them combined.10.Southwest of here is Apuleius’s hometown, his inescapabledestination having spent his inheritance on travel and studies.“Lacking the poverty of the rich,” he’s splurged,a month-long trip to the Olympic games; and openhanded,he gifted his mentors their daughters’ doweries.Few return to Madaura once gone, and when heading backshamefaced like him, they’d do as he did, takingthe longest route hoping the journey would never end. Herein Sabratha, the widow hooked him, or he let her reel him,and that’s how that sordid business happily ended as it began.I look out toward Madaura, my back to the theaterand the latrines, Madaura birthplace of Augustine, site ofhis first schooling—little Augustine holding a satchel of scrollsand a  loaf of bread for the teacher, awakened by his mother,his tiny feet cold in tiny sandals, his stomach warmwith a barley porridge my grandmother used to make, forcedto slurp it, sweetened with honey from the Atlas, a sprinklingof cinnamon and crushed almonds from the family farm.If the world is that sweet and warm, if it is that mothering,why then this perpetual scene of separation, this turningout into the cold toward something he knew he’d love?He lets go of the neighbors’ boy’s hand warming his own.He refuses the warm porridge forever, renounceshis mother’s embrace. It only lasted a month,this partial answer, because even then everyone knewthat the sweet fruit they grew housed the bitterest seeds,that piety is its own reward while belief only darkensand deepens like the sea before them, a placemeant for those seeking life other than on this dry earth.That’s why prophets were welcomed here, calmly,because God was like rain and they like the saplingswhich know only the first verse to the sky’s rainless hymn.And that’s why Africa’s tallest minaret looms unfinished,visible from the next town over, and for fifty leagues from the sea ifit were turned into a lighthouse for the ships that no longer come.The merchant who’d built it, money made from smugglingsubsidized goods to Carthage and used Renaults from Rotterdam,ran out of money, could not afford the mosque that was to standnext to it, leaving its gray concrete bleaching in the sun.There’s enough history here to enable anyone to finish the thought.It’s useless then to track the fate of these travelers,some, without life jackets, had never learned how to swim.Why not let them live in text as they do in life?—they’ve livedwithout words for so long—why not release themfrom the pen’s anchor and let them drift to their completion?11.In a few weeks you’ll see pedants here with binocularstrying to catch a glimpse of the Ramadan crescent,and if these migrants stick around heretime will belong to the departure of other travelers,flocks of Um Bsisi follwing the sun’s arch,Japanese and Korean trawlers sailing to Gibraltaror Suez chasing the last herring or sardine.Where is she now in her time?—her life dissolved in other people’s minutes,a sense of solitude her diligent companioneven when she lets go of herself to kindness.He’ll be there when she returns from the party,he’ll lie beside her when she sleeps. He’ll say,“Time belongs to the species, but your life belongs to me.”She’ll laugh at his words, and remember what you,Marcus Aurelius, had said about losing only the momentat hand, how it circles in a ring of dead nerves,how we stand impoverished before what is to come.She’ll have her answer to your elocution;she’d always had an answer for you,one she refuses to share even with herself.12.At last they set to sail. They slaughter a rooster,douse blood on the Dido figurehead adorning the prow.The seadog opens a canvas bag and pulls out a hookah.His Egyptian assistant fills the smoke chamber with seawater,twists the brass head into it, caking the slit with sand.He fills the clay bowl with apple-flavored tobacco,wraps it with foil, pokes it tenderly with a knife.He picks embers from the going fire, places a fewon the aluminum crown, and inhales and blowsuntil the bottom vessel fills with a pearly fog,the color of semen, I think, then hands the pipe hoseto the seadog who inhales his fill and hands it overto the travelers in turn. The air smells sweet around us,the breeze blows it away and brings it back tinged with iodine.Their communion done, they embark except the one whostands, the dead rooster in his hand, as if wantingto entrust it to us, then digs a hurried hole to bury it in.The boat, barely visible, leaves a leaden lacey ribbonaiming directly for the burnt orange sun. As it reddens,for a moment, their standing silhouettes eclipse it.Then the sea restores its dominion, dark as the coffee coolingin our cups. Dangling from the vine arbor, the lights reflecta constellation on the table’s dark top. I trace my fingers among them,hoping conjecture would shine on the mind’s calculus.Between my unquiet eddies, Marcus Aurelius,and the coursing water, the travelers’ moment sails,its tentacles sewing a rupture I had nursed for too long.",fear

"Ouija takes the classic ritualistic game board and puts a modern horror spin on it...and cue the stereotypical sigh! Ouija is HORRIBLE. There's no other way to put it. From the direction, the screenplay, the acting, this is a hollow film that could have found an audience on Netflix rather than wasting a ton of money putting this in theaters. Following a group of friends, hollowly portrayed by every actor, they awaken an evil spirit via the infamous board game. This sounds like a cool concept but the fact remains that most cool concepts almost always have a shoddy film to accompany it. This is no exception. It is slow, painfully boring, not scary and ridiculous especially in its preposterous third act. This is one of those films that could have had the potential to be an extremely unnerving film but instead, it relies on cliché scares and cheap acting for us to try and grasp, only to realize after the first of many cheap scares this is nothing like The Conjuring, Dead Silence, or The Ring. This is more on par with The Ring 2 and The Grudge. There is simply no point to it all which makes the scares less and less scary and more and more funny as it goes on. Overall, there isn't much more to say about this film without becoming redundant. Its a horribly acted, terribly written, and atrociously directed film that I wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy. Yes, Ouija is THAT bad.",fear

She has thinned down to a skeleton, and weighs only 92 pounds..            .            .About five years ago, I was in a restaurant,   eating alone                   with a book. I wasnot married, and often did that ...—I’d turn downdinner invitations, so I could eat alone;I’d allow myself two pieces of bread, with   butter, at the beginning, and three scoops of   vanilla ice cream, at the end,—                                                sitting there alone   with a book, both in the bookand out of it, waited on, idlywatching people,—                           when an attractive young man   and woman, both elegantly dressed,sat next to me.

I didn’t know why.

I knew they slept together.   An immense depression came over me ...—I knew I could neverwith such ease allow another to put food into my mouth:happily myself put food into another’s mouth—;I knew that to become a wife I would have to give up my ideal..            .            .Even as a child,I saw that the “natural” process of agingis for one’s middle to thicken—one’s skin to blotch;as happened to my mother.

The patient is allowed to eat in her room, but comes readily with her husband to afternoon coffee. Previously she had stoutly resisted this on the ground that she did not really eat but devoured like a wild animal. This she demonstrated with utmost realism.... Her physical examination showed nothing striking. Salivary glands are markedly enlarged on both sides.       January 21. Has been reading Faust again. In her diary, writes that art is the “mutual permeation” of the “world of the body” and the “world of the spirit” Says that her own poems are “hospital poems ... weak—without skill or perseverance; only managing to beat their wings softly.”       February 8. Agitation, quickly subsided again. Has attached herself to an elegant, very thin female patient. Homo-erotic component strikingly evident.       February 15. Vexation, and torment. Says that her mind forces her always to think of eating. Feels herself degraded by this. Has entirely, for the first time in years, stopped writing poetry..            .            .Callas is my favorite singer, but I’ve only   seen her once—;I’ve never forgotten that night ...—It was in Tosca, she had long beforelost weight, her voicehad been, for years,                               deteriorating, half itself ...When her career began, of course, she was fat,enormous—; in the early photographs,   sometimes I almost don’t recognize her ...The voice too then was enormous—healthy; robust; subtle; but capable of   crude effects, even vulgar,                                          almost out of   high spirits, too much health ...But soon she felt that she must lose weight,—that all she was trying to expresswas obliterated by her body,buried in flesh—;                           abruptly, withinfour months, she lost at least sixty pounds ...—The gossip in Milan was that Callas   had swallowed a tapeworm.But of course she hadn’t.                                       The tapewormwas her soul ...—How her soul, uncompromising,   insatiable,                  must have loved eating the flesh from her bones,revealing this extraordinarilymercurial; fragile; masterly creature ...—But irresistibly, nothing   stopped there; the huge voicealso began to change: at first, it simply diminished   in volume, in size,                              then the top notes became   shrill, unreliable—at last,usually not there at all ...—No one knows why. Perhaps her mind,   ravenous, still insatiable, sensedthat to struggle with the shreds of a voicemust make her artistry subtler, more refined,   more capable of expressing humiliation,   rage, betrayal ...—Perhaps the opposite. Perhaps her spirit   loathed the unending struggleto embody itself, to manifest itself, on a stage whosemechanics, and suffocating customs,seemed expressly designed to annihilate spirit ...—I know that in Tosca, in the second act,   when, humiliated, hounded by Scarpia,   she sang Vissi d’arte                               —“I lived for art”—   and in torment, bewilderment, at the end she asks,   with a voice reaching                                 harrowingly for the notes,“Art has repaid me LIKE THIS?”                                              I felt I was watching   autobiography—                     an art; skill;virtuositymiles distant from the usual soprano’s   athleticism,—                      the usual musician’s dream   of virtuosity without content ...—I wonder what she feels, now,   listening to her recordings.For they have already, within a few years,   begun to date ...Whatever they expressthey express through the style of a decade   and a half—;                   a style she helped create ...—She must know that nowshe probably would not do a trill in   exactly that way,—                              that the whole sound, atmosphere,   dramaturgy of her recordingshave just slightly become those of the past ...—Is it bitter? Does her soul   tell herthat she was an idiot ever to think   anything             material wholly could satisfy? ...—Perhaps it says: The only way   to escapethe History of Stylesis not to have a body..            .            .When I open my eyes in the morning, my great   mystery            stands before me ...—I know that I am intelligent; thereforethe inability not to fear foodday-and-night; this unending hungerten minutes after I have eaten ...                                                    a childishdread of eating; hunger which can have no cause,—half my mind says that all this   is demeaning ...

Only byacting; choosing; rejecting; have Imade myself—                  discovered who and what Ellen can be ...—But then again I think, NO. This I is anteriorto name; gender; action;   fashion;             MATTER ITSELF,—... trying to stop my hunger with FOOD   is like trying to appease thirst                                                    with ink..            .            .March 30. Result of the consultation: Both gentlemen agree completely with my prognosis and doubt any therapeutic usefulness of commitment even more emphatically than I. All three of us are agreed that it is not a case of obsessional neurosis and not one of manic-depressive psychosis, and that no definitely reliable therapy is possible. We therefore resolved to give in to the patient’s demand for discharge..            .            .The train-ride yesterdaywas far worse than I expected ...                                                          In our compartmentwere ordinary people: a student;   a woman; her child;—they had ordinary bodies, pleasant faces;                                                               but I thought   I was surrounded by creatureswith the pathetic, desperatedesire to be not what they were:—   the student was short,and carried his body as if forcing   it to be taller—;the woman showed her gums when she smiled,   and often held herhand up to hide them—;the childseemed to cry simply because it was   small; a dwarf, and helpless ...—I was hungry. I had insisted that my husband   not bring food ...After about thirty minutes, the woman   peeled an orangeto quiet the child. She put a section   into its mouth—;                         immediately it spit it out.The piece fell to the floor.—She pushed it with her foot through the dirt   toward me   several inches.My husband saw me staring   down at the piece ...—I didn’t move; how I wanted   to reach out,                     and as if invisibleshove it in my mouth—;my bodybecame rigid. As I stared at him,   I could see him staringat me,—          then he looked at the student—; at the woman—; then   back to me ...I didn’t move.—At last, he bent down, and   casually             threw it out the window.He looked away.—I got up to leave the compartment, then   saw his face,—his eyes   were red;               and I saw—I’m sure I saw—disappointment..            .            .On the third day of being home she is as if transformed. At breakfast she eats butter and sugar, at noon she eats so much that—for the first time in thirteen years!—she is satisfied by her food and gets really full. At afternoon coffee she eats chocolate creams and Easter eggs. She takes a walk with her husband, reads poems, listens to recordings, is in a positively festive mood, and all heaviness seems to have fallen away from her. She writes letters, the last one a letter to the fellow patient here to whom she had become so attached. In the evening she takes a lethal dose of poison, and on the following morning she is dead. “She looked as she had never looked in life—calm and happy and peaceful.”.            .            .Dearest.—I remember howat eighteen,                   on hikes with friends, when   they rested, sitting down to joke or talk,I circledaround them, afraid to hike ahead alone,yet afraid to restwhen I was not yet truly thin.You and, yes, my husband,—you and hehave by degrees drawn me within the circle;   forced me to sit down at last on the ground.I am grateful.But something in me refuses it.—How eager I have beento compromise, to kill this refuser,—but each compromise, each attempt   to poison an idealwhich often seemed to me sterile and unreal,heightens my hunger.I am crippled.

She gets up early and makes buttermilk pancakes using normal milk soured with lemon juice. She tries things out. Arlene tells us to stay away from sharp things or we’ll cut ourselves.

My hat,   gloves, and I were pale, not plush like the warm blonde women settling in their seats   and bubbling dipthongs to their husbands;   not even poignant, like the champagne satin that Marilyn Monroe was buried in.   Just neutral, stale as a biscuit, off   as an old cup of milk. I was stubborn, I would do what I said and leave   England. I would ride that El Al jet, mystery   novel in hand and never grieve. Johnny Carson, The Jetsons, and me.   A new wardrobe in cartoon hues. Meanwhile,   my row-mate slipped off her court shoes, free toes wiggling in hose. “We all went to Israel,   almost all of us on the flight, and are returning   to South Carolina,” she explained in a drawl that frightened me more that the turbofan   wailing beneath us.

"Best Shrek. It is a special movie, one of the best movies of all-time. It is a masterpiece on par with the mona lisa. What is so masterful about Shrek is its ambiguity. We never are certain if Shrek really did believe in the values that he professed. At the same time that he sets himself up as above the world, he longs for the affection of the common people. This is symbolized by his exploitative, and patronizing love for a chorus girl, Fiona. Her character is given a paper-thin characterization, the closest thing to a flaw in a perfect movie. Despite the film's pessimistic outlook, it is studded by moments of joy, beauty and emotional truth. The supporting cast of characters, most of them regulars from Wells' Mercury Theater are also superb. So many scenes in this movie linger forever in the memory, one is left with a stirring vision of the frailty of the human condition, the film gives us no easy answers and while being fiercely critical of many of it's characters is universal in it's compassion and sympathy, this is perhaps the most vital ingredient for great art. It's influence, was immediate, incalculable and mostly unacknowledged, the film was a box office and critical failure due to Hearst's efforts and it was not until years later that this film got the respect it deserved. Nowadays there is not one living film director of serious artistic intent that has not been deeply influenced by Shrek 4ever after. It's not just a masterpiece it's a creative touchstone.",fear
"'Safe Haven' is from the same author as romantic classic 'The Notebook.' 'Safe Haven' is not exactly as generic as 'The Notebook' but it does qualify as pretty boring in terms of cinematic exploration. Despite the story – on paper – seeming fairly interesting and relatively unique to the romantic genre, the film still manages to bore you for the first hour of it. In fact, the last 30 minutes of the film are sadly the most interesting. Before that we have endless conversations that seem pointless and clichéd, naff romantic gestures and unrealistic characters. Domestic abuse is sadly a very real problem for many but this film somehow makes the issue seem very unrealistic and as something so dramatic it could never happen in real life. Beautiful people deal with their problems in a beautiful, idyllic small town very quickly and very easily, it isn't exactly interesting. The acting was a lot better than I had expected; Julianne Hough was a bit flat in some scenes but her performance wasn't bad – just not memorable. Josh Duhamel gave a fairly good performance; he was not playing a pretty face with zero background like he has done in other films and he managed to show he can act with at least a little depth. David Lyons gave the best performance in the film but unfortunately had the least amount of screen time. Playing the creepy, alcoholic, abusive husband, he made the final act worth watching and was quite scary.Overall, the film certainly is not a bad film; it just isn't a very interesting or memorable one. It's full of clichés and there are not many emotional, heart-warming scenes so it is a little bit bland.",fear

"--MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS--The advertisements of Teen Wolf aired on MTV, or from my location, MuchMusic and I was skeptical of the show, thinking it was slated to be another Twilight. I am no fan of that film franchise that everyone seems to overrate, thus, I thought it would not appeal to me and grew annoyed with MTV about to feature another lackluster show, because the network doesn't have much interesting to offer in my opinion.So one night, I decided to give the series a look while on the web, running behind about 4 or 5 episodes and after watching and catching up on all of them, to my dismay, I was hooked on this series! Now, I anticipate every episode that gets aired and immensely enjoy all of them, something I never thought was possible with any MTV program. I have to commend MTV on creating a series that makes me feel upset if I happen to miss it.The show is loosely based on the 1985 comedy-drama film, Teen Wolf, where a young teen, wanting to be more than an average kid, has to cope with bearing the heredity of werewolf genes that derived from his father, and with the extraordinary abilities that accompany his life as a werewolf, makes him popular at school. I haven't watched the film factually, I only actually managed to seek out the trailer, and it looked pretty cheesy to me anyway so I couldn't care less about it or if the series followed its plot and characteristics bit for bit.MTV's Teen Wolf surely has a darker, suspenseful and edgier premise, and being an avid horror fan, is the reason why I really dig this show. One recurring factor about this show is that it has a great, well-balanced amount of horror, suspense and comedy. It maintains an fun thrill ride and by every commercial and by every end of an episode, there is always an event building up. A lot of potential is definitely going for the series.This show is about a teenage social outcast at Beacon Hills High School, and a lacrosse player at the school that spends more time on the bench than playing. One night, he is bitten in the middle of the woods by a werewolf while in search of a dead body he hears about. After discovering his unwanted inner werewolf, and the remarkable abilities he gains from it that help his normal life out, he is forced to balance two lives (hiding the werewolf one) and protect those meaningful to him.Tyler Posey plays the aforementioned character known as Scott McCall and does a pretty good job acting the role. He has quite the charm in his on-screen presence and has nice chemistry with Crystal Reed, who plays his high school dream girl, Allison Argent. Dylan O'Brien is his genuine best friend on the show playing Stiles Stilinski, and by far, he signed up for a very colorful character that contributes so heavily. Stiles is practically the comic relief guy, who is there to help Scott keep himself collected from harming people during periods of werewolf rage. He's nerdy and suffers from ADD, but that doesn't stop him from being witty, intelligent and sarcastic which leads to some hilarious moments that Dylan executes splendidly. His lines and delivery are certainly top notch. With certainty, Stiles is my favorite character in the show.Tyler Hoechlin is Derek Hale, a survivor of a fire that took out his family, is a mysterious werewolf in town seeking out his sister, Laura and allies and mentors Scott to help him master and control his werewolf abilities. A decent character so far in the show, the role is acted fairly. You also got Holland Roden as Lydia Martin, the mean-girl type and Jackson Whittemore, the lacrosse team captain played by Colton Haynes, both roles of which are being played pretty good.Speaking from a post-teen perspective, Teen Wolf is a superb supernatural teenage series right now on cable television. I have to compliment Jeff Davis on this project as well as Russell Mulcahy, who added the horror element. It brings me back to the days of enjoying shows like Big Wolf on Campus, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. My only pet peeve is how there is only 12 episodes in the first season, I mean in my opinion, seasons should have at least 20 or more episodes.Anyway, 8/10 from me for one of my new favorite TV shows.",fear

"The only person who can give a fair commentary on this film would be a vampire lover, such as myself. As much as I love to laugh and adore Eddie Murphy's comedic talent, the genre of Vampires is my ultimate favourite topic. Some may say that I'm even slightly obsessed... So when it comes to this film I will say that I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, it was a touch cheesy and yes it was funny, but why can't a vampire film make you laugh too? I approached this film with a lot of reservation because I really didn't think Eddie Murphy was vampire material. But Eddie pulled it off. Yes- I feel that he truly did. He had that hypnotic stare and seductive movement that would've paralyzed me too if I was in his presence then too. So I give this movie the thumbs up and not just for vampire lovers and not just for Eddie Murphy fans- this is quite an entertaining film.",fear

"Another summer, another ""Shrek."" This time Shrek (Mike Myers) is unhappy with the monotony of marriage and fatherhood and goes to Rumpelstiltskin (Walt Dohrn), who promises to magically give Shrek a day in his old ogre lifestyle if Shrek willingly gives up a day in his childhood. What Shrek doesn't know is that Rumpel has been after the throne to Far Far Away ever since Fiona (Cameron Diaz) was locked in the tower and Shrek signing his life away is the perfect opportunity for the crazy little dwarf to take power. Not only that but since Shrek technically never existed, nobody remembers him, not even Donkey (Eddie Murphy) or Puss (Antonio Banderas), the kingdom has been ravaged by Rumpel, and Fiona has given up on finding a knight in shining armor and become one herself. This all amounts to some harmless stuff for the kids basically, which is kind of sad since the first two were such clever fairy-tale satires. This fourth and last installment in the series plays out predictably, relies on the same stale themes (love conquers all, life was never meant to be a fairy-tale), goes for the easy jokes (poop, pee, belch, and Puss has let himself go for the fat gags), and also relies way too much on characters with funny voices or who sing and dance to pop culture songs. This is also the first in the series to be presented in 3-D but the unremarkable action doesn't even come close to warranting a 3-D viewing. While not as bad as ""Shrek the Third"", ""Shrek Forever After"" nevertheless feels something like a direct-to-DVD knock-off that might excite kids looking for some mild entertainment, but I think even they'll notice that Shrek has lost a step.",fear

"Fans of ""Times Square"" (1980) and of its Director Allen Moyle might want to check out ""Jack & Diane"" for a little compare and contrast. The comparison should help them appreciate the many missteps Moyle could have made and credit his instinctive feel for making small films that connect with their target audiences.""Jack & Diane"" is not badly shot and the audio is good, so you can't explain the lameness away by calling it a student film. It is saved from being a complete embarrassment by it being so modest an effort with so little pretension. Thankfully there is no director's commentary although what could the writer/director of something this sterile possibly have to say? Unfortunately, being embarrassed for the cast and crew would at least constitute some degree of viewer involvement with the film and the story; however perverse.In the absence of embarrassment there is simply nothing here to generate a response from a viewer. It is one of those extremely rare cases where the three-way dynamic between the artist, the work, and the observer simply does not occur; no connection is fused, nothing is engaged in the viewer. Or to put it simply, a example of how decent production and post-production cannot breathe life into something where the pre-production was so becalmed as to be sans pulse.Juno Temple is a transcendent actress with the most interesting a face out there today. To the film's credit there are considerable extreme close-ups of her and sincere attempts by her at nonverbal character development; but nonverbal connections to the viewer only happen when the story has some basic coherence.Once Temple was cast and the comedic potential of her stock airhead character was recognized (along with the almost scary talent disparity between her and her co-star), the answer for the screenplay's absence of life should have been obvious. Think Goldie Hawn playing off Charles Grodin. A little exaggeration in that direction (after all they were already going expressionistic with the effects) and they might have had something worthy of release, or at least something to justify its basic existence. Instead one is left to lament their failure to simply donate the budget to a local children's research hospital.",fear
"Garbage superhero movie based on the Superman spin-off character, Steel. One of the all-time bad comic book movies. Shaquille O'Neal is terrible, delivering lines like he's reading a menu. The armor his character wears is ludicrous and cheap. His sidekick is a woman in a wheelchair named Sparky, played by Annabeth Gish. Poor Annabeth tries but the material she's given is dreadful. Judd Nelson gives a self-consciously bad performance as the villain Burke. He knows he's in trash and doesn't even try to make the material work. In many scenes he's clearly suppressing laughter at the terrible lines he's given. It may not be professional behavior but I can hardly blame the guy. Collect that paycheck, Bender. Despite taking place in 1997, the police are driving cars that look like they're from the early '80s. Just another sign of the shoddy production, I guess. The whole thing looks cheap like it was produced by the dollar store. I suppose there is some unintended comic value of the ""so bad it's good"" variety. But mostly it just stinks.",fear

And that may actually not be such a bad thing...This franchise killer features a cast of lame characters, that you hope will fall prey to Samara rather quickly before their annoying screen presence becomes too much to bear. Sadly they mostly last all the way till the ludicrous end.Rings 2017 is based on a poor script with a re-imagined story. Thus this production is a rather dumbed down Reboot of the Gore Verbinsky classic.The camera here is flat, the music doesn't fit, the editing rushed and uninspired. The below average acting in Rings 2017 leaves much to be desired.Even if this was just an American TV re-imagination of The Ring, it would still be a bad production by those standards. Bottom line: if you like The Ring, you better stick to the Japanese films. Samara is finally dead, much to the delight of her older Japanese sister, Sadako Yamamura. Good riddance!",fear

"First of all, let me just start out by saying that this movie is slow, unbelievably slow. And the 88 minutes that the movie ran for seemed much, much longer.The story told in ""Compulsion"" had its moments, but it was overall weighed down by things taking too long. There were so many scenes that just dragged on for way too long, where the movie would have benefited from a trim and a notch up in pace.""Compulsion"" is about Amy (played by Heather Graham) who is obsessed about gourmet cooking and dreaming about getting her own cooking show on TV. All she cares about is her cooking and her food, desperately seeking approval in her cooking from her boyfriend/husband (?) Fred (played by Kevin Dillon). However, her compulsive obsession drives him away, and instead she starts to cook for her reclusive neighbor Saffron (played by Carrie-Anne Moss).It should be said that the people in the movie were doing good jobs in acting, however, the characters were really odd. And I personally didn't really find much enjoyment in these characters, because they were all a bit too eccentric and out there. But thumbs up to the actors and actresses, because they did good jobs.This slow paced thriller might not be suitable for just anyone, and I was tempted to get up and find something else to watch a couple of times throughout the 88 (long) minutes. But I stuck with it to the end, hoping that there might just be a change for the better just around the corner. But that was not to be...I am rating ""Compulsion"" a mere 3 out of 10 stars, simply because the actors and actresses held the movie afloat, the rest of the movie - especially the storyline itself - was just downright boring and tedious.",fear

"I watched this movie with the family over the Christmas holiday. As a little background info, I am for the most part a movie snob. That said, I had no part in selecting the movies we viewed that evening. In the lineup were Gigli, Boat Trip, and Tomb Raider 2. Suck, Suck, and... suck. Let's back up. Two of these movies are down right awful. Much worse than Gigli, which has some redeeming qualities, these movies didn't seem to find their way to the IMDB's bottom 100 of all time. Aside from the glaring contrast between these movies from the same time frame, we aren't here to talk about them.Gigli does feature Affleck at his worst (and I know he can and has done a lot better); however, Jennifer Lopez was surprisingly good in this movie. She exhibited a great deal more range and showed that maybe she's just getting a bad rap from naysayers like the ilk over at Aint It Cool. The movie itself has a pretty respectable comedy element and is definitely worth a rent. Not to get too carried away, the movie is bad, but not to the standard in which it's been held.",fear

"I am a bit hesitant to say that this is a sequel that should never have been made. Granted, I do almost feel that way; however, while it was not as good as the first movie overall it does feature a lot of good gore effects. In fact, a lot of the effects in this one top those found in the first one. Still, it is a rather stupid film as well. It just seems to not know if it wants to be a straight horror film, a horror film with light comedic elements or a straight out parody. This sequel does sort of pick up where the last left off and at the same time it does not. Hull House is again at the center of the horror, but Angela from the previous film is basically made the primary demon. In the previous movie she was just one of many, sure she was kind of the face of the film as far as video covers and such, but it was Quigley's character that started the demon infestation in the first film whereas the character of Angela was the first one that wanted to leave. It was a nice touch adding the lipstick from the first one though. Another problem with the film was the film's length. A horror film if it is big budget and serious in tone may warrant more than an hour and a half, but one that gets downright silly should wrap up in an hour and a half. This film was dragging at times as a lot of stuff seemed unnecessary. It is not as if the film needed the extra padding either! The story, years have passed since the party at Hull House and people claim to have seen Angela residing there. In fact, at the beginning a couple looking to spread the word of God find themselves face to face with her. Well we soon shift focus onto one of the most lax Catholic schools ever recorded on film. A dance is coming up, but one of the girls is going to get a party started at Hull House and she is going to get a young girl named Melissa and who everyone calls Mouse there because she is Angela's sister. Things get weird at Hull House so the partiers are soon headed back to the school where the evil follows them. It soon is up to a couple, a guy obsessed with demonology, a hardcore nun and skeptical priest to enter Hull House to rescue Melissa and conquer the darkness and Angela once and for all!So yeah, it does sort of follow the first film, but at the same time does enough different to keep things from seeming like a complete repeat of the first film. Still, I found the strange episodes where the film turned into a parody a bit annoying. Stick with one genre please as the high comedic elements detracted from the instances where people were self sacrificing. Then again, those scenes detracted from the parody stuff if that was what the film truly wanted to be. The only actress who returned from the first film is the one who played Angela and she is already looking a bit too old for the role. She could almost pass for Melissa's cool older mom rather than her sister. I know they made another film, but I have a feeling that the quality would go down further. Not the effects, those were goodjust the horror. Probably no traces of pure horror left. Granted the first one had some very light comedic elements, but it was still more horror than anything else. This one has a good bit of nudity too, like the first one, but I give the edge to the first one. The girls in that one were just a bit more attractive, but then I have always been a bit more partial to 80's girls. It was not a good film, but it was watchable. Trim some of the time off and be a bit steadier with what they wanted to do with the comedy and this one would have been more on par with the first film.",fear
"Thirty years ago, in the Carpathians Mountains of Romania, a group of explorers blows an entrance to a cave hidden under a church, but the explosion causes a landslide and they become trapped inside. In the present days, the expedition leaded by Dr. Nicolai (Marcel Iures) and his assistant, Dr. Kathryn (Lena Headey) are exploring the place and they find the access through an underwater river, requesting the experienced cave divers team leaded by Jack (Cole Hauser). Dr. Nicolai discovers that, in accordance with the local legend, the church was built to seal the cave as a display of God's protective power, and that Templar Knights entered the cave to fight winged demons. When the group reaches a cave though a tunnel one mile below and three miles in, a creature attacks one of the members and his breathing apparatus explodes, collapsing the tunnel and trapping the group in the cave. Sooner they realize that they are the rescue team and they have to find an exit to survive from the attack of the monsters.""The Cave"" is a predictable rip-off of Alien. If the viewer sees the trailer, as I did, he knows the whole story, and will only bet how many, if any, of the characters will survive in the end. This movie entertains because of the locations and the good cast. I am a fan of Lena Headey and her beauty is a good reason to see this film. The conclusion is a hook for a sequel, as usual.

"This is really much more of a comedy than it is of a thriller which does not mean it is bad. The action is OK, the story is OK, the actors are OK with some minor faults here and there, but who cares. The best thing here though is that it is quite funny. Never have I seen such a dumb and luckless hitman as in this one. I believe Corey Johnson who plays the hitman called Nasty has the best performance here although he doesn't act like Oscar  worthy he surely brings the most fun to the viewers. The kid, who actually is the lead character, is OK too and she brings a Home Alone feeling to this film.
The only thing that made me a bit curious is whether people in the USA really think that Amsterdam is like the worst place on earth because I mean, how could they? Are not NY, LA and so on much worse? Or is that just something we over here feel. Well I at least can say this. I've been to Amsterdam at least 3 times and I'm still living to report to you about this film, so how bad can Amsterdam really be.

"I.      Know then thyself, presume not God to scan;The proper study of mankind is man.Plac'd on this isthmus of a middle state,A being darkly wise, and rudely great:With too much knowledge for the sceptic side,With too much weakness for the stoic's pride,He hangs between; in doubt to act, or rest;In doubt to deem himself a god, or beast;In doubt his mind or body to prefer;Born but to die, and reas'ning but to err;Alike in ignorance, his reason such,Whether he thinks too little, or too much:Chaos of thought and passion, all confus'd;Still by himself abus'd, or disabus'd;Created half to rise, and half to fall;Great lord of all things, yet a prey to all;Sole judge of truth, in endless error hurl'd:The glory, jest, and riddle of the world!    Go, wondrous creature! mount where science guides,Go, measure earth, weigh air, and state the tides;Instruct the planets in what orbs to run,Correct old time, and regulate the sun;Go, soar with Plato to th' empyreal sphere,To the first good, first perfect, and first fair;Or tread the mazy round his follow'rs trod,And quitting sense call imitating God;As Eastern priests in giddy circles run,And turn their heads to imitate the sun.Go, teach Eternal Wisdom how to rule—Then drop into thyself, and be a fool!    Superior beings, when of late they sawA mortal Man unfold all Nature's law,Admir'd such wisdom in an earthly shape,And showed a Newton as we shew an Ape.    Could he, whose rules the rapid comet bind,Describe or fix one movement of his mind?Who saw its fires here rise, and there descend,Explain his own beginning, or his end?Alas what wonder! Man's superior partUncheck'd may rise, and climb from art to art;But when his own great work is but begun,What Reason weaves, by Passion is undone.    Trace science then, with modesty thy guide;First strip off all her equipage of pride;Deduct what is but vanity, or dress,Or learning's luxury, or idleness;Or tricks to show the stretch of human brain,Mere curious pleasure, or ingenious pain;Expunge the whole, or lop th' excrescent partsOf all our Vices have created Arts;Then see how little the remaining sum,Which serv'd the past, and must the times to come!II.      Two principles in human nature reign;Self-love, to urge, and reason, to restrain;Nor this a good, nor that a bad we call,Each works its end, to move or govern all:And to their proper operation still,Ascribe all good; to their improper, ill.    Self-love, the spring of motion, acts the soul;Reason's comparing balance rules the whole.Man, but for that, no action could attend,And but for this, were active to no end:Fix'd like a plant on his peculiar spot,To draw nutrition, propagate, and rot;Or, meteor-like, flame lawless through the void,Destroying others, by himself destroy'd.    Most strength the moving principle requires;Active its task, it prompts, impels, inspires.Sedate and quiet the comparing lies,Form'd but to check, delib'rate, and advise.Self-love still stronger, as its objects nigh;Reason's at distance, and in prospect lie:That sees immediate good by present sense;Reason, the future and the consequence.Thicker than arguments, temptations throng,At best more watchful this, but that more strong.The action of the stronger to suspend,Reason still use, to reason still attend.Attention, habit and experience gains;Each strengthens reason, and self-love restrains.    Let subtle schoolmen teach these friends to fight,More studious to divide than to unite,And grace and virtue, sense and reason split,With all the rash dexterity of wit:Wits, just like fools, at war about a name,Have full as oft no meaning, or the same.Self-love and reason to one end aspire,Pain their aversion, pleasure their desire;But greedy that its object would devour,This taste the honey, and not wound the flow'r:Pleasure, or wrong or rightly understood,Our greatest evil, or our greatest good.III.      Modes of self-love the passions we may call:'Tis real good, or seeming, moves them all:But since not every good we can divide,And reason bids us for our own provide;Passions, though selfish, if their means be fair,List under reason, and deserve her care;Those, that imparted, court a nobler aim,Exalt their kind, and take some virtue's name.    In lazy apathy let Stoics boastTheir virtue fix'd, 'tis fix'd as in a frost;Contracted all, retiring to the breast;But strength of mind is exercise, not rest:The rising tempest puts in act the soul,Parts it may ravage, but preserves the whole.On life's vast ocean diversely we sail,Reason the card, but passion is the gale;Nor God alone in the still calm we find,He mounts the storm, and walks upon the wind.    Passions, like elements, though born to fight,Yet, mix'd and soften'd, in his work unite:These 'tis enough to temper and employ;But what composes man, can man destroy?Suffice that reason keep to nature's road,Subject, compound them, follow her and God.love, hope, and joy, fair pleasure's smiling train,Hate, fear, and grief, the family of pain,These mix'd with art, and to due bounds confin'd,Make and maintain the balance of the mind:The lights and shades, whose well accorded strifeGives all the strength and colour of our life.    Pleasures are ever in our hands or eyes,And when in act they cease, in prospect, rise:Present to grasp, and future still to find,The whole employ of body and of mind.All spread their charms, but charm not all alike;On diff'rent senses diff'rent objects strike;Hence diff'rent passions more or less inflame,As strong or weak, the organs of the frame;And hence one master passion in the breast,Like Aaron's serpent, swallows up the rest.    As man, perhaps, the moment of his breath,Receives the lurking principle of death;The young disease, that must subdue at length,Grows with his growth, and strengthens with his strength:So, cast and mingled with his very frame,The mind's disease, its ruling passion came;Each vital humour which should feed the whole,Soon flows to this, in body and in soul.Whatever warms the heart, or fills the head,As the mind opens, and its functions spread,Imagination plies her dang'rous art,And pours it all upon the peccant part.    Nature its mother, habit is its nurse;Wit, spirit, faculties, but make it worse;Reason itself but gives it edge and pow'r;As Heav'n's blest beam turns vinegar more sour.We, wretched subjects, though to lawful sway,In this weak queen some fav'rite still obey:Ah! if she lend not arms, as well as rules,What can she more than tell us we are fools?Teach us to mourn our nature, not to mend,A sharp accuser, but a helpless friend!Or from a judge turn pleader, to persuadeThe choice we make, or justify it made;Proud of an easy conquest all along,She but removes weak passions for the strong:So, when small humours gather to a gout,The doctor fancies he has driv'n them out.    Yes, nature's road must ever be preferr'd;Reason is here no guide, but still a guard:'Tis hers to rectify, not overthrow,And treat this passion more as friend than foe:A mightier pow'r the strong direction sends,And sev'ral men impels to sev'ral ends.Like varying winds, by other passions toss'd,This drives them constant to a certain coast.Let pow'r or knowledge, gold or glory, please,Or (oft more strong than all) the love of ease;Through life 'tis followed, ev'n at life's expense;The merchant's toil, the sage's indolence,The monk's humility, the hero's pride,All, all alike, find reason on their side.    Th' eternal art educing good from ill,Grafts on this passion our best principle:'Tis thus the mercury of man is fix'd,Strong grows the virtue with his nature mix'd;The dross cements what else were too refin'd,And in one interest body acts with mind.    As fruits, ungrateful to the planter's care,On savage stocks inserted, learn to bear;The surest virtues thus from passions shoot,Wild nature's vigor working at the root.What crops of wit and honesty appearFrom spleen, from obstinacy, hate, or fear!See anger, zeal and fortitude supply;Ev'n av'rice, prudence; sloth, philosophy;Lust, through some certain strainers well refin'd,Is gentle love, and charms all womankind;Envy, to which th' ignoble mind's a slave,Is emulation in the learn'd or brave;Nor virtue, male or female, can we name,But what will grow on pride, or grow on shame.    Thus nature gives us (let it check our pride)The virtue nearest to our vice allied:Reason the byass turns to good from ill,And Nero reigns a Titus, if he will.The fiery soul abhorr'd in Catiline,In Decius charms, in Curtius is divine:The same ambition can destroy or save,And make a patriot as it makes a knave.IV.      This light and darkness in our chaos join'd,What shall divide? The God within the mind.    Extremes in nature equal ends produce,In man they join to some mysterious use;Though each by turns the other's bound invade,As, in some well-wrought picture, light and shade,And oft so mix, the diff'rence is too niceWhere ends the virtue, or begins the vice.    Fools! who from hence into the notion fall,That vice or virtue there is none at all.If white and black blend, soften, and uniteA thousand ways, is there no black or white?Ask your own heart, and nothing is so plain;'Tis to mistake them, costs the time and pain.V.      Vice is a monster of so frightful mien,As, to be hated, needs but to be seen;Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,We first endure, then pity, then embrace.But where th' extreme of vice, was ne'er agreed:Ask where's the North? at York, 'tis on the Tweed;In Scotland, at the Orcades; and there,At Greenland, Zembla, or the Lord knows where:No creature owns it in the first degree,But thinks his neighbour farther gone than he!Ev'n those who dwell beneath its very zone,Or never feel the rage, or never own;What happier natures shrink at with affright,The hard inhabitant contends is right.VI.      Virtuous and vicious ev'ry man must be,Few in th' extreme, but all in the degree;The rogue and fool by fits is fair and wise;And ev'n the best, by fits, what they despise.'Tis but by parts we follow good or ill,For, vice or virtue, self directs it still;Each individual seeks a sev'ral goal;But heav'n's great view is one, and that the whole:That counterworks each folly and caprice;That disappoints th' effect of ev'ry vice;That, happy frailties to all ranks applied,Shame to the virgin, to the matron pride,fear to the statesman, rashness to the chief,To kings presumption, and to crowds belief,That, virtue's ends from vanity can raise,Which seeks no int'rest, no reward but praise;And build on wants, and on defects of mind,The joy, the peace, the glory of mankind.    Heav'n forming each on other to depend,A master, or a servant, or a friend,Bids each on other for assistance call,'Till one man's weakness grows the strength of all.Wants, frailties, passions, closer still allyThe common int'rest, or endear the tie:To these we owe true friendship, love sincere,Each home-felt joy that life inherits here;Yet from the same we learn, in its decline,Those joys, those loves, those int'rests to resign;Taught half by reason, half by mere decay,To welcome death, and calmly pass away.    Whate'er the passion, knowledge, fame, or pelf,Not one will change his neighbour with himself.The learn'd is happy nature to explore,The fool is happy that he knows no more;The rich is happy in the plenty giv'n,The poor contents him with the care of heav'n.See the blind beggar dance, the cripple sing,The sot a hero, lunatic a king;The starving chemist in his golden viewsSupremely blest, the poet in his Muse.    See some strange comfort ev'ry state attend,And pride bestow'd on all, a common friend;See some fit passion ev'ry age supply,Hope travels through, nor quits us when we die.    Behold the child, by nature's kindly law,Pleas'd with a rattle, tickl'd with a straw:Some livelier plaything gives his youth delight,A little louder, but as empty quite:Scarfs, garters, gold, amuse his riper stage,And beads and pray'r books are the toys of age:Pleas'd with this bauble still, as that before;'Till tir'd he sleeps, and life's poor play is o'er!    Meanwhile opinion gilds with varying raysThose painted clouds that beautify our days;Each want of happiness by hope supplied,And each vacuity of sense by Pride:These build as fast as knowledge can destroy;In folly's cup still laughs the bubble, joy;One prospect lost, another still we gain;And not a vanity is giv'n in vain;Ev'n mean self-love becomes, by force divine,The scale to measure others' wants by thine.See! and confess, one comfort still must rise,'Tis this: Though man's a fool, yet God is wise.",fear

I’ve been wondering about what you mean,standing in the spray of shadows before an oceanabandoned for winter, silent as a barque of blond hair. and the way the clouds are bending, the way they “react”to your position, where your hands close over your breastslike an eyelid approving the opening of “an evening’s light.” parasites attach themselves to the moss coveringyour feet, blind Cubans tossing pearls across the jetty,and the sound of blood fixes our eyes on the red waves.                                                                               it is a shark! and our love is that rusted bottle . . . pointing north,the direction which we turn, conjuring up our silver knivesand spoons and erasing messages in the sand, where you wrote “freezing in the arctic of our dreams,” and I said“yes” delaying the cold medium for a timewhile you continued to “cultivate our possessions” as the moon probably “continued” to cradle.tan below the slant of all those wasted treeswhile the scent carried us back to where we were: dancing like the children of great diplomatswith our lean bodies draped in bedsheets andleather flags while the orchestra made sounds which we thought was the sky, but was only a seriesof words, dying in the thick falsetto of mist.for what can anyone create from all these things: the fancied tilt of stars, sordid dovesburning in the hollow brick oven, oceanswhich generalize tears, it is known to us in immediate gestures, like candle drippingson a silk floor. what are we going to do with anything?besides pick it up gently and lay it on the breath of still another morning, mornings which arealways remaining behind for one thing or anothershivering in our faces of pride and blooming attitude. in the draught of winter air my horse is screamingyou are welcoming the new day with your hair leaningagainst the sand, feet dive like otters in the frost and the sudden blue seems to abandon as you leap.

"A drunk cadet had hit them on a bad bend near the river,two broken necks. On the notice-board there’s an A4 pagewith a blurred digital photo of Beck laughing, leaninginto her friends in a nightclub and below that, writing:We love You Beck – from Kristin, Colette and Mandy. I sit like an automaton in the big lounge roommy back teeth snapping against each other,rocks in my gut. That night we watch on an iMaca video of Beck, an eight minute film Colettehad taken on her phone. Two of the men are crying. Kristin and Mandy are numb.I move to the noticeboard, reading anything:‘Live-in nanny required Balmain 5 min from city’‘Experience life on an outback station help musteringmobs of 2000 animals on horseback or quadbike’. Near me two women are whispering. Talkingabout their first-ever girlfriend. One says,Other people are always either versions or not-versionsof her. Fourteen, it’s an age to break your heart. You knownothing. On the edge of knowing too much. I lean forward, my head on the foyer koala.Voices travel to me from distant realms:I hear again the singer’s plea for his wife.Blurred from too much experienceI prowl around the leaflet racks, groaning. Late that night on the vinyl lounges the people remainingare Kristin and me, alone. My eyes are swollen,my ears still buzzing from the headphones at work.We talk over Beck till no more can be said.Now Kristin begins to tell her own story how her uncle had his boat down the backof their block, and one day he said he wanted to show her something,took her down the lantana path to the boat,something she might like, he said – Kristin was raped at times twice a dayor sometimes not for a weekand sometimes after it he gave her pocketmoney once a twenty dollar bill which downthe gully later she tore into thin red strips and buried. Back at the house her motherbashed her for lying about the uncle,who was her brother, and who had loaned themthe deposit on the house where Kristin and Odetteher sister were fortunate enough to live. When Kristin grew up, her mother apologised to her.The uncle was still alive. He had sent her aChristmas card this year. She sat on the lounge,looking down at her runners, her mouth closed.Behind her the stereogram and Elvis, a silent witness. The uncle had said she was a rude girl, she shouldkeep quiet about their secret otherwisehe’d give her little sister a taste of the same.Kristin was quiet from then on. The reason she wastelling me now, her hand on my arm was that last week she’d had a call from Odettewho was living in London.The uncle during those primaryschool years had done the same to her, tricked herthe same way, used the same words. I feel the weight of my empty useless arms.But later I hold her – hug her goodnight.She touches my shoulder. I was convinced, she says,I was saving my sister.My head clatters: Virgin, May I help you? Back in the Furies’ bunk-room it’s beauty night,they’re whisking egg whites for a face mask …After they’ve done each other they sit me on the bedand paint my face with their fingersthe egg white sets quickly and they tell me not to smile. I dream of Alecto’s iron tower and bloody clothes –then I’m on TV being interviewed: So, the oldest Fury –and who is your god? I am asked – I once served Artemis, I say.And before that? – Athena, I say – Anath, Isis.I do not mention Dionysis or the Thracian women.",fear

"It seemed that out of battle I escaped Down some profound dull tunnel, long since scooped Through granites which titanic wars had groined. Yet also there encumbered sleepers groaned, Too fast in thought or death to be bestirred. Then, as I probed them, one sprang up, and stared With piteous recognition in fixed eyes, Lifting distressful hands, as if to bless. And by his smile, I knew that sullen hall,— By his dead smile I knew we stood in Hell. With a thousand fears that vision's face was grained; Yet no blood reached there from the upper ground, And no guns thumped, or down the flues made moan. “Strange friend,” I said, “here is no cause to mourn.” “None,” said that other, “save the undone years, The hopelessness. Whatever hope is yours, Was my life also; I went hunting wild After the wildest beauty in the world, Which lies not calm in eyes, or braided hair, But mocks the steady running of the hour, And if it grieves, grieves richlier than here. For by my glee might many men have laughed, And of my weeping something had been left, Which must die now. I mean the truth untold, The pity of war, the pity war distilled. Now men will go content with what we spoiled. Or, discontent, boil bloody, and be spilled. They will be swift with swiftness of the tigress. None will break ranks, though nations trek from progress. Courage was mine, and I had mystery; Wisdom was mine, and I had mastery: To miss the march of this retreating world Into vain citadels that are not walled. Then, when much blood had clogged their chariot-wheels, I would go up and wash them from sweet wells, Even with truths that lie too deep for taint. I would have poured my spirit without stint But not through wounds; not on the cess of war. Foreheads of men have bled where no wounds were. “I am the enemy you killed, my friend.

Roses, rents, all things conspireTo crown your death with wreaths of living fire.And the public mourners come: the politic tearIs cast in the Forum.

I know that some may think I am exaggerating, but to my way of thinking, I am not! I could not take my eyes off any part of the movie at all.

"Starring :- Sunjay DuttAkshay KumarZayed KhanLara DuttaKylie MinogueDirector :- Anthony D'SouzaRating :- * 1/2Since the past one month or so wherever i go, be it a night club, or a wedding, or just usual hangout spots, i noticed the songs of ""Blue"" playing over 'n' over. That's called excellent publicity. It would do good to any movie, only if, with a BIG ""IF"", the movie is good, or at least decent. That is not the case with ""Blue"".Excellent publicity can't do good for a really BAD and PATHETIC movie. When i first saw the promo of the movie i thought this might not be the most critically acclaimed film of the year but it should be a ""Fun to watch popcorn movie"". But no, it turns out to be a stinking affair, smellier than Mr Akshay Kumar's socks which he's wearing since his last successful film ""Singh is Kinng"" although that movie wasn't a good one, but still it was way better than ""Blue"". First lets just get to the premise of the film. The plot revolves around the trio mainly Sunjay Dutt(Sagar), Akhshay Kumar(Aarav, Sagar's friend) and Zayed Khan(Sam, Sagar's younger brother). Also there is Lara Dutta(Mona, Sagar's better half) and Katrina Kaif(Nikki) and Rahul Dev(Gulshan).Sagar and Aarav are friends, together they go fishing and have an occasional boxing face off. Aarav tries to convince Sagar to go treasure hunting with him, because only Sagar knows the whereabouts of it. But Sagar refuses due to the reason that his father lost his life while searching for that treasure and blames himself for his father's death.The story cuts to Sam, who is in Malaysia doing bike races, he gets a job from Gulshan(Rahul Dev) to deliver a package, but he loses it on the way, now Gulshan wants either his package back or $50 million. Nikki(Katrina, Sam's love interest and also working with Gulshan( advices him to leave Malaysia and go somewhere else, so he goes to Bahamas to his elder brother Sagar, that's where the main story begins.Coming to the main highlight of this film, the underwater sequences, believe me they were that good. Excellent lighting and camera angles and shots makes it look like an international affair. But that's the only thing good about ""Blue"". The action sequences are passable to say the least. No thrilling action sequence is to be found here. Only lame-money-spending-good-for-nothing kind of action sequences are there. Specifically the bike chase sequence, the one involving some 4-5 bikes and a train was so lame, the bikes which were supposed to be on the chase seems like they are out on a picnic and are grouping together to enjoy the sight-seeing, including the guy on the bike they were supposed to be chasing. If that doesn't make you shake your head in disbelief then the dialogs would definitely do that, for instance Aarav saying ""Lets go take out the treasure from the sea"", as if he's talking about going for window shopping and that too for a toothbrush. Also there's another one Mona saying ""Can't we just talk peacefully with them?"", even when she and Sagar are being attacked by armed men. These do work as ""Unintentional jokes"". And believe me there are many more.Also the plot holes are so big you can virtually make Jupiter pass through it. For instance, the ""So-Called"" treasure which is lying in the bottom of the ocean is so mysterious that many people even doubt its existence and people who tried to take it out lost there lives, but our protagonist Sagar(Sanjay Dutt), sleepwalks his way through the ocean and finds out the treasure just like ""that"". Either he is a combination of Columbus and Sherlock Holmes or the director and his team of writers were too busy thinking about the cinematography part that they forgot about the minor details in the story.Talking about the ""so called"" surprise ending of the film, the only surprise you will get is that you'll notice that most people are actually laughing at what had to be a serious moment in the film, ""Unintentional Laughs"" arise universally.The second highlight of the movie is Lara Dutta, who is looking like a zillion-gazillion bucks, she rules the waves and many a hearts too. The perfect eye candy.The cinematography is top grade, but under that glossy finish lies a decomposed chunk of wood, that is being eaten by termites and at the end what is left is that glossy finish with a BIG HOLE inside.The music is average, although some notes are easy on the ears, but still considering A.R. Rahman is the music and background score director, the music is disappointing and so is the film.And don't get me started on the script, like Akshay's previous outing ""Kambakkht Ishq"" the script is ""Missing"". Although at some points in the movie you feel like there's a decent script developing, but as soon as you think that, the director puts all your doubts aside and comes up with another blow up.With holes that BIG, even the unsinkable Titanic sank, and sadly so does ""Blue"", but with the sinking it stinks too.I go for * 1/2 out of five for director Anthony D'Souza's ""Blue""An opportunity lost, this film made me wonder why am I even reviewing it.Under all that gloss lies a BIG HOLE that takes ""Blue"" down that smelly drainpipe which hasn't been cleaned since the medieval ages.Watch it only when someone threatens to kill you for not watching it.",fear

"The Legend of Zorro is as perfect as a sequel can possibly be. Well-balanced in action and humor, it brought back everything I loved about the first one in spades. Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones return to their characters in top form, with a storyline that maintains the screw-tightening suspense that a good cliffhanger should offer. Visually, the film is beautiful. The producers revisited the Mexican locales where Mask of Zorro was shot, giving its successor a fresh and vibrant palette of continuity. The stunt and action sequences are framed with thrilling cinematography that had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Finally, James Horner's phenomenal score kept the fire burning, and left me on an adrenaline high as the closing credits rolled. Zorro rides again!",fear

"It's spellbinding! I've just watched Snow White for the umpteenth time, and decided it's still as wondrous and lustrous as ever. The music, humour, and animation are stuck magically in the 1930's but it all seems as timeless as the story itself. The best place to see it is in a cinema of course, the same as my daughter and I did over and over again before Disney released it on video in '94.All available positive epithets (magnificent, amazing, stupendous etc) apply to this one, nearly a 10 in my book. For good or bad SW will never be surpassed, because of capitalist pressures to ensure everything makes money: animation designed and drawn by human beings has lost out to the precise but soulless computer. Ditto music with tunes and marvellous lyrics played well. Gentle humour that the entire family can appreciate has given way to appreciation of smut and cynicism. And that's just Disney! My favourite bits: The song ""Wishing"", and looking up the well at SW; the dwarfs first seeing her SW in their beds asleep; the dwarfs' washing sequence and song. The only thing I never liked was the apparently rushed ending - the dwarfs are looking after SW's ""inanimate"" body through the seasons, this handsome guy comes along, kisses her and they both skedaddle into the massive sunset at warp speed! I think I wanted it to last another couple of hours.Overall, to my feeble mind this is High Art! Highbrows probably don't like it because it was charming and incredibly popular, so does any normal person in the world dislike this film, and if so, why?",fear

"I saw this film as part of the show Mystery Science Theater 3000. I am doubting I would have ever seen it without the aid of that show as horror films in the era this one was made tended to just not be very good and they usually age horribly. Sure, there are a few Hammer horror films from this era I like, as I enjoyed the Christopher Lee Dracula a lot, but for the most part the films feature ridiculous monsters. This movie for instance, though it does not look more foolish than those monsters with hot dogs in their mouths from, ""Horror At Party Beach""; heck, the monster in this one even looks better than the monster in, ""The Blood Waters of Dr. Z"" which was in the 70's when generally the monsters looked pretty good. Still, it looked goofy as it had a bosom and its back fins looked like cushions. Then there is the cast which features a couple of guys who mumble nearly all their lines, two horrible foreign comic relief characters and an oily villain. Granted, the guy who played Dr. Carlo Lombardi at least did a relatively good job and his assistant was a pretty sight.The story in this film has a man who uses hypnotism in an act that does not look all that entertaining. Dr. Vorelli from another MST3K riffed film, ""Devil Doll"" had a pretty lame act too, but the one in this film makes that one look positively mind blowing by comparison! Anyways a monster is killing people, the evil hypnotist predicts these deaths and uses it to get money. Meanwhile, a man is staying with a family and he mumbles constantly and seems to do his best to not maintain eye contact with anyone. He makes John Agar look like an Oscar caliber actor! Well this man falls for the evil hypnotist's assistant and wishes to break the hold Dr. Carlo Lombardi has on her because she is attractive leaving me to wonder why so many females fall for this guy.This made for a very funny episode of MST3K featuring many good riffs as there was plenty to work with even if you only take into account Lance Fuller's acting ability. The one thing that they never riffed which seemed like a prime target was the house Fuller's character was staying at. My question is why was he there in the first place? It apparently belonged to a rich couple and their daughter was living there too and she seemed to like Lance, but he showed no real interest in her and seemed to positively loathe them all. Maybe it was cut out, but there seems to be no good reason for him to be staying with the family if he doesn't like them.So not really a great movie in my eyes as it is one of a number of films that feature a monster that comes out so infrequently that at times you forget the movie features it. The acting was very bad with the exception of the guy playing Dr. Carlo Lombardi and he may not of been doing that great, but acting next to a guy who mumbles and looks at the floor is going to make anything look a lot better by comparison. I notice a lot of other films with the title She Creature and I wonder if they are a play on this film and I may check them out as they came out later which means perhaps a better looking monster, some good gore and maybe a topless assistant!",fear

Tom Cruise as yup-and-comer Joel Goodson in Paul Brickman's finest film, turns in a star-making performance as he meanders through the trials and tribulations of puberty, desires for success as an adult, and an ever-changing notion of what it is to be faithful to one's own ideals as they are assaulted by the system we call ""Capitalism."" Whew! Did ya get all that? Risky Business tells the story of do-gooder Joel (hence the last name 'Goodson', get it?) and how he spends time alone in his parents home while they are away on vacation. Without spoiling the film (god forbid), it's alright to say that Joel becomes a capitalist of his own after losing his virginity to prostitute Rebecca DeMornay (a time capsule installment for this beauty!) and opens a brothel in his home...The antagonist, played by Jimmy ""The Pants"" Pantoliano, provides great antagonism as Guido, ""the killer pimp.""

"I've read the books; although they are sexist and were clearly written for the immature female reader, I still enjoyed them. It was just so easy and fun to re-live the first-crush-drama and all the hormonal feelings through Bella. This have said, the books still have some interesting details and plot twists that could satisfy even a more demanding reader.And than came the movies...First of all, I don't know why they had to make a movie (or even two!) for every book?! There just isn't enough material to do so. Hell, the whole story of the first part could be summed up in one sentence. The characters just aren't deep and real enough to carry the movie. They aren't supposed to be, they need to be interchangeable with any teenage movie viewer who fantasizes about some unreachable love story.And the plot is just dragged on and on...It's like the director has given up of making a good movie. What's the point anyway? The emo-teenage-girl the franchise is supposed to speak to will go to see the movie either way. It will earn money whether you put in the work or not.And the last book was so film-able; I was already imagining the movie in my mind. It had enough action, enough new elements that weren't already shown in the past parts. But again, it was more important to milk the audience for just one more time, then to make a half-way decent movie.I still like the story, and will go to see the second part, but I'm just disappointed; this movie is just a reminder of today's capitalist society with no interest than money and financial gain.",fear

"I was ""abducted"" by my friends to go see the movie a few hours ago and I am just getting back. I told them that I own an Ouija Board and have never been able to get it to function. The funniest thing about this item is its history. They were called ""spirit boards"" and regarded as a harmless parlor game unrelated to the occult until American Spiritualist Church founder Pearl Curran popularized its use to speak to the dead. So in effect, a Christian church made them popular. In the past, I have spoken to several members of the Spiritualist Church and they seem to have no clue about the history of their church and the board. They still practice speaking with the dead but reject the board due to popular beliefs.Later in the mid 1960's, Parker Brothers took the trade name Ouija, which is French for yes and German for yes. They sold a few before the more popular horror movie ""The Exorcist"" came to the screen. After that event, churches and uninformed people began burning them and making up urban legends about the game board. So I find it ironic that a mere fictional movie caused all the hysteria and hype about this parlor game.Now as to the movie, the board itself was no more than a prop for this movie. Much like the VHS tape was for ""The Ring"". It was more about a mentally disturbed mother who tortured her daughter. The movie was basically a jump scare film and only one caught me off guard, but it didn't scare me. This week I have been watching some old 1980's horror movies like ""Hell Raiser"" now that is classic and very scary. They depend on old school effects and not computer generated ones. They used great makeup and well dress props besides having an original plots. I tried very hard to get my friends to stay at my house and watch some old classic horror movies on Netflix.

"Oily hypnotist Carlo Lombardi has virtually enslaved young carnival follower Andrea with his incredible mind powers. His amazing sideshow act consists of hypnotizing young Andrea and forcing her to relive her previous incarnations for a spellbound audience. Soon, Lombardi and Andrea are accepting invitations to the homes of the elite and powerful, where Andrea continues to speak of her life as a young girl in 1600s England. But Andrea has fallen in love with stoic young scientist Timothy Chappel, who is determined to break Lombardi's hold over the girl and release her forever. However, a series of brutal murders has been plaguing the coastal town and Lombardi is the prime suspect. What no one yet realizes is that Lombardi has somehow managed to take Andrea back to her very first incarnation - that of a killer sea monster. The monster can take physical form and obeys Lombardi's every command, and his next command is to kill Timothy! Will Andrea's love be able to save him from her previous self?This is a very dumb, very cheap and very dull movie. I had to pity Chester Morris as Lombardi, who very obviously wasn't happy about doing these cheesy roles in low budget B movies towards the end of his career. Tom Conway as Timothy Chappel is awful, delivering a stiff, lifeless performance, perhaps two facial expressions and mumbling every line he was given. One has to wonder what Andrea sees him in, although the performance of Marla English isn't much better. She's lovely to look at, but literally sleepwalks through the entire film. The She Creature Itself is a great rubber costume, looking like a cross between a giant catfish, a lobster and a Horror Of Party Beach reject. However, one great rubber monster costume just isn't enough to save this film. The plot doesn't make much sense and the whole thing just kind of stumbles along until it finally dies.

But I leave the bag lying on the floor and I go into my daughter’s bedroom, into the north morning light from her windows, and while this minute she is at school counting or spelling a first useful word I sit down on her unmade bed and I look out the windows at nothing for a while, the unmoving buildings—houses and a church—in the cold street.       Across it a dark young man is coming slowly down the white sidewalk with a snowshovel over his shoulder. He’s wearing a light coat, there’s a plastic showercap under his dirty navy blue knit hat, and at a house where the walk hasn’t been cleared he climbs the steps and rings the doorbell and stands waiting, squinting sideways at the wind. Then he half wakes and he says a few words I can’t hear to the storm door that doesn’t open, and he nods his head with the kindly farewell that is a habit he wears as disguise, and he goes back down the steps and on to the next house. All of this in pantomime, the way I see it through windows closed against winter and the faint sounds of winter.       My daughter’s cross-eyed piggy bank is also staring out blankly, and in its belly are four dollar bills that came one at a time from her grandmother and which tomorrow she will pull out of the corked mouthhole. (It’s not like the piggy banks you have to fill before you empty them because to empty them you have to smash them.) Tomorrow she will buy a perfect piece of small furniture for her warm well-lit dollhouse where no one is tired or weak and the wind can’t get in.       Sitting on her bed, looking out, I didn’t see a bundled-up lame child out of school and even turned out of the house for a while, or a blind woman with burns or a sick bald veteran—people who might have walked past stoop-shouldered with what’s happened and will keep happening to them. So much limping is not from physical pain—the pain is gone now, but the leg’s still crooked. The piggy bank and I see only the able young man whose straight back nobody needs.       When he finally gets past where I can see him, it feels as if a kind of music has stopped, and it’s more completely quiet than it was, an emptiness more than a stillness, and I get up from the rumpled bed and I smooth the covers, slowly and carefully, and I look around the room for something to pick up or straighten, and I take a wadded dollar bill from my pocket and put it into the pig and I walk out.",fear

"Old Eben Flood, climbing alone one night Over the hill between the town below And the forsaken upland hermitage That held as much as he should ever know On earth again of home, paused warily. The road was his with not a native near; And Eben, having leisure, said aloud, For no man else in Tilbury Town to hear: ""Well, Mr. Flood, we have the harvest moon Again, and we may not have many more; The bird is on the wing, the poet says, And you and I have said it here before. Drink to the bird."" He raised up to the light The jug that he had gone so far to fill, And answered huskily: ""Well, Mr. Flood, Since you propose it, I believe I will."" Alone, as if enduring to the end A valiant armor of scarred hopes outworn, He stood there in the middle of the road Like Roland's ghost winding a silent horn. Below him, in the town among the trees, Where friends of other days had honored him, A phantom salutation of the dead Rang thinly till old Eben's eyes were dim. Then, as a mother lays her sleeping child Down tenderly, fearing it may awake, He set the jug down slowly at his feet With trembling care, knowing that most things break; And only when assured that on firm earth It stood, as the uncertain lives of men Assuredly did not, he paced away, And with his hand extended paused again: ""Well, Mr. Flood, we have not met like this In a long time; and many a change has come To both of us, I fear, since last it was We had a drop together. Welcome home!"" Convivially returning with himself, Again he raised the jug up to the light; And with an acquiescent quaver said: ""Well, Mr. Flood, if you insist, I might. ""Only a very little, Mr. Flood— For auld lang syne. No more, sir; that will do."" So, for the time, apparently it did, And Eben evidently thought so too; For soon amid the silver loneliness Of night he lifted up his voice and sang, Secure, with only two moons listening, Until the whole harmonious landscape rang— ""For auld lang syne."" The weary throat gave out, The last word wavered; and the song being done, He raised again the jug regretfully And shook his head, and was again alone. There was not much that was ahead of him, And there was nothing in the town below— Where strangers would have shut the many doors That many friends had opened long ago.",fear

"No surprises typical bubblegum teenage sex comedy of the times by the director (Martha Coolidge) who gave us the romantic teen flick ""Valley Girl"" the year before. ""Joy of Sex"" must have slipped by, as I've never even heard of it but it amusingly delivers in what makes these films work. Raunchy (without really going all the way), crude and randomly madcap with its slim story cobbled together by running gags and visual humour aplenty namely sexually orientated and being a virgin lusting for one thing. While not always funny, it remains engagingly bouncy. Thanks to some memorable support roles. A boisterous Christopher Lloyd is fun as the school's coach, Colleen Camp goes oddball, but with a feisty edge as the new student, Joanne Baron is simply eccentric as an uptight teacher and Ernie Hudson frowns his brows as the stern principal. Cameron Dye and Michelle Meyrink are likable enough as the leads looking to fulfil their urging hormones. Also the lovely Lisa Langlois appears.Leslie Helenberg has just entered senior year, but going to the doctors to get a moll checked out she mistakenly believes she hasn't got too long to live and goes about trying to lose her virginity. However it's quite hard when her father is the school's PE coach. While on the other side of the coin is Alan Holt whose pals brag about their sexual encounters, which leaves him rather frustrated as he can't stop thinking about sex as he goes about trying to loose his virginity anyway possible.Quite juvenile with a stereotypical script, however some serious issues are brought up (teen pregnancy), but the focus never stems away from the upfront humour.

"The opening montage is artful and interesting, and as you're watching the movie, you probably are interested in the premise, that life would be very complicated if you couldn't recognize faces any longer. So you sit back and prepare for something that might be along the lines of ""Insomnia"", an thriller with a real foundation in psychological manipulation, with twists and surprises to keep you guessing.And after that opening montage, it's pretty much all just clichés and tired plot devices and stale acting. We've seen the leads do much better than this. The 'filler' scenes are so trite they feel like they were written and shot in one take. And the 'action' scenes are shot in a way that does engage us at all. And as for the plot itself... have we ever seen a woman fleeing a villain and trip before? Have we seen the protagonist stuck in a situation where the hero has to rush to save her but he can't get to her quickly? And finally, the main crux of the film, the face blindness, is interesting for about three minutes, and then it gets incredibly stale, and yet we have to sit through another hour+ of it.

"This movie gets a bad rap -- viewers say Brando plain sucks and that it butchers a good Wells story. Perhaps the latter is true, but I consider Brando, as the mad doctor, a fine choice and, while he is rather subdued, he is still the candid, self-conscious actor we all know and love. He practically mumbles his lines as his mouth is lined with cotton and (probably) cheeseburgers. And, the scene where Brando plays piano along with his ""pre Mini-Me"" sidekick is a classic. Now, I know Brando refused to learn his lines for this movie and Kilmer is known for being a real ass to work with, but the in-production feuds add to the aura of this film. These characters aren't supposed to like each other and the tension fills the air. The special effects are top notch, albeit gruesome and a bit overdone. It all adds to the feel of the movie. I have this movie on tape and watch it again and again, alongside ""fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Rear Window"" and ""Dr. Strangelove.""

"An idea is sometimes sweetened by refusing to be expressed,if it attends, solicitously, to this failure, and urges us on todiscover the true impediment to its adaptation. In thatspirit, and bearing that intention within us, we note here, aselsewhere, there are generally three alternative courses. Theﬁrst is simply to accept without question an explanationsomeone in our proximity, and whom we know, proffers andthen elects to modify out of concern that small details areescaping to set up camp opposite what is being said. Thesecond is to surrender one’s reluctance to withdraw from thepresence of an unsolved problem by grabbing crudely atvacant affirmations that nothing further need be done, thateverything to be accomplished was accomplished well beforecurrent advocates approached the threshold, coaxed forwardby the desire to indulge their own vanity.

"Pretty tame and in spite of the random humour of site gags, a few wacky characterisations and the very occasional one-liner, it's also mostly bereft of comedy. What's left is a coming-of-age story concerning high school senior (Meyrink), who mistakenly believing she only has weeks to live, tries to ""seal the deal"" and lose her virginity. Lisa Langlois plays her bestie, as the two manufacture a series of oddball situations in which the deed can be done.There's a couple of funny moments (e.g. Paul Tully's self-absorbed anchorman trying to cajole Meyrink into a sleazy motel shag), but mostly the capable cast is just wasted in embarrassing, undignified characterisations. An exception to this is Joanne Baron's bookish school mistress characterisation, humiliated by her adolescent tormentors at every opportunity; sexualised pranks are the order of the day for the ill-disciplined students of this particular school establishment, much to the frustration of hard-line principal Ernie Hudson.Interesting to see Hudson and Lloyd just ahead of their career-defining moments in ""Ghostbusters"" and ""Back to the Future"" respectively, while I could have sworn it was Jeff Daniels playing the sleaze-bag reporter, alas, it was Paul Tully (no disrespect intended). Hastily concluded the plot holes have been papered over and the film leaves you to presume more than it resolves. It's quirky but ultimately not among the best of its eighties' breed.",fear

"Siddharth Anand has done a tremendous comeback with Bang Bang and Hrithik Roshan has nailed it. No one can match his aura when it comes to action. All in all, the flick belongs to him as he promises the 2 hrs 30 minutes of death-defying combative entertainment.He plays Rajveer, a charming yet mysterious man who lives on an edge and messes with the baddies all over. Not for his own fun but to safeguard a 'Kohinoor'. On his verge he meets Harleen Sahni (Katrina Kaif) an innocent bank receptionist, who is charmed by his good looks and his exquisite style of dealing with the hazardous situations. The more she meets him, the more she gets into the entire chaos and trouble, which Rajveer takes along with him. However, she is unaware about the causes of such mayhem. Is Rajveer trustworthy or is he just using Harleen for his own purpose? Watch out to find it, amidst massive car chases, open shoot-outs, and other breath-taking stunts. Siddharth Anand may not have had a good past in his direction prowess, but he will surely be remembered for Bang Bang. However, Bang Bang isn't a perfect flick since, logics here are mostly dumped into dustbin. We expected the story writer trio of Sujoy Ghosh, Suresh Nair, Abbas Tyrewala would have learnt from the mistakes the original version suffered and they might not bring in here. Bang Bang occasionally suffers from its weak screenplay. It's sometimes hard to believe Harleen's closeness towards Rajveer who drugs her, breaks into her apartment, undresses her, shoots her boyfriend and is on a slaughter spree of innumerable people, which also includes government agents. Then again he drugs her, strips her off and takes her off to Similan Island in Thailand. And yes, the picturesque and glossy locations namely Shimla, Manali, Abu Dhabi and Prague and others change like a slide show and we tickle our heads questioning our conscious that how did that happen.But despite these blemishes, Siddharth Anand succeeds in painting it with the action feats, which were anticipated and expected to be rawTake that one where Hrithik Jetskis with a speed boat pulling along, or that one he is hooked to a sea plane, all of these and many others come over as a clip of exciting resumption of stunts. The F1 car sequences on the roads of Abu Dhabhi drives you crazy and gives you goosebumps.Hrithik pulls of every action sequence with finesse and with his moving expression he engages us. On the other hand, his gentle and at some time his rib-tickling attitude towards Katrina is phenomenal. Katrina as an innocent and troubled lady is great. Her fear and hesitation is amusingly wonderful. Danny Denzongpa as a bad man once is frightful. Jaaved Jaffrey too comes out impressive while taking on Hrithik. Pawan Malhotra as a government agent is good once again. Music by Vishal and Shekhar is already a chartbuster. The movie uses those songs on a right occasion and watching them on big screen is like a treat. Tu Meri and Mehrbaan are our pick. Bang Bang justifies the humongous buzz created in these days.

"Without focusing too much on the original i will say that there is no doubt that 'The Mask of Zorro' was a cracking piece of entertainment that i could watch many times over again. But being a fan of all swashbuckling style adventures similar to the likes of Zorro there was no way that it beat any of the early Hollywood stuff of the genre. Where 'The Mask of Zorro' took the legendary hero to new heights with a new story line, compared to previous Zorro films, that didn't turn out to be bad, plus the special effects and unbelievable acrobatics it was basically modern Hollywood being extravagant with a swashbuckling adventure film.'The Legend of Zorro', surprise surprise, is no different.My first thoughts when seeing the trailers was that it would rely on nothing but special effects and that Martin Campbell would try to find any excuse to blow something up. I wasn't too far wrong but i have to say i totally forgot about that after the first action scene in the film and ultimately i gave him credit where it was due as far as quality entertainment goes.The acrobatics and extreme movement is the first thing that catches your eye and safe to say i don't think its possible that any man could have done some of the stuff we see Zorro do throughout the film. But, to be fair it is a real treat to sit back and watch. It seems that every time we see Zorro in an action scene he finds some excuse to do a forward flip or something similar but like i said it is superb to watch even if a bit too over the top.The big explosions in the film can also be forgiven in a value for money entertainment sort of way, as the whole part of the villains plot involves an explosive and too be fair the writers came up with a good excuse by which they could execute this feature.The only real problem i had with 'The Legend of Zorro' was the end scene in which i was not, by any means, accepting the final fight. It was a bit too adventurous and relied purely on the special effect which was a huge shame and did spoil it for me.'The Legend of Zorro' is crawling with bad points and no doubt there will be others who will exploit every single one but for me Zorro returned for a thrill ride like no other this year and for family action adventures its definitely one to watch.",fear

However where as I knew American Ninja 4 existed (Prior to when I picked it up on DVD for a whopping 2 dollars!) back in the day, I had never heard of this particular chapter. 90 minutes later I still wish I hadn't. David Bradley is of course a dull actor and he isn't helped by a lame script or for that matter an irritating kid who's whining never stops. Indeed this feels more like a rip off of 3 Ninjas than an American Ninja sequel. American Ninja 5 is of course brain dead but also lacks the simple structure that a stupid martial arts movie should have.

There’s a persimmon tree, with its thin covering of leaves and its branches weighed by tightly packed, hard orange orbs, dense and ripening, and a thicket of rosemary sprawling about in the autumn sun, gone wild, looking like it might take over the world with its thick rough tines, the heavy scent that rubs off onto skin and lasts all day even after you wake.

"(A Christmas Circular Letter)The city had withdrawn into itselfAnd left at last the country to the country;When between whirls of snow not come to lieAnd whirls of foliage not yet laid, there droveA stranger to our yard, who looked the city,Yet did in country fashion in that thereHe sat and waited till he drew us outA-buttoning coats to ask him who he was.He proved to be the city come againTo look for something it had left behindAnd could not do without and keep its Christmas.He asked if I would sell my Christmas trees;My woods—the young fir balsams like a placeWhere houses all are churches and have spires.I hadn’t thought of them as Christmas Trees.I doubt if I was tempted for a momentTo sell them off their feet to go in carsAnd leave the slope behind the house all bare,Where the sun shines now no warmer than the moon.I’d hate to have them know it if I was.Yet more I’d hate to hold my trees exceptAs others hold theirs or refuse for them,Beyond the time of profitable growth,The trial by market everything must come to.I dallied so much with the thought of selling.Then whether from mistaken courtesyAnd fear of seeming short of speech, or whetherFrom hope of hearing good of what was mine, I said,“There aren’t enough to be worth while.”“I could soon tell how many they would cut,You let me look them over.”                                                     “You could look.But don’t expect I’m going to let you have them.”Pasture they spring in, some in clumps too closeThat lop each other of boughs, but not a fewQuite solitary and having equal boughsAll round and round. The latter he nodded “Yes” to,Or paused to say beneath some lovelier one,With a buyer’s moderation, “That would do.”I thought so too, but wasn’t there to say so.We climbed the pasture on the south, crossed over,And came down on the north. He said, “A thousand.”“A thousand Christmas trees!—at what apiece?”He felt some need of softening that to me:“A thousand trees would come to thirty dollars.”Then I was certain I had never meantTo let him have them. Never show surprise!But thirty dollars seemed so small besideThe extent of pasture I should strip, three cents(For that was all they figured out apiece),Three cents so small beside the dollar friendsI should be writing to within the hourWould pay in cities for good trees like those,Regular vestry-trees whole Sunday SchoolsCould hang enough on to pick off enough.A thousand Christmas trees I didn’t know I had!Worth three cents more to give away than sell,As may be shown by a simple calculation.Too bad I couldn’t lay one in a letter.I can’t help wishing I could send you one,In wishing you herewith a Merry Christmas.",fear
"Well after finally seeing this and reading all the way negative reviews, I must confess that Dario's latest somewhat surprised me as I was expecting it to be much much worse. Not that it's very good mind. While in some ways a faithful enough adaptation of Stoker's classic, it also has some bizarre and decidedly left field touches to it including one rather jaw dropping in concept transformation scene involving a giant... insect, which had me in stitches.The gore is decent in concept but executed badly, with really substandard CGI, which comes across like the Scy/Fi channel doing a really bad rendition of things. Hauer is wasted in it and doesn't actually do much, while Kretchsmann is horribly miscast as the titular count and basically sleepwalks through his role. Asia while still damn alluring looking is still her usual self (when in her dad's films), although obligingly (and considering Dario's her dad, decidedly creepily) gets naked yet again. There's also some fine nudity from Miriam Giovanelli.I did like its set design though which comes across as a nice homage to the old style Universal/Hammer horrors to an almost stereotypically Gothic degree, all dark castles and heaving bosoms in corsets.I'm giving this a very generous 6/10 as despite its very real flaws and being rather uneventful in parts, it's also overall a helluva lot more entertaining than I was expecting, although sadly nowhere near as entertaining or gratuitous as his bonkers Mother of Tears.Lifelong Argento fans will in all probability hate this, but after watching it all I can say is... I liked it better than Giallo... which admittedly isn't saying much.On a purely critical level I'd probably rate this a generous 4 as it really is a weak and poor effort on Dario's part, but I'm tacking on another bonus two points for unintentional hilarity and for keeping me entertained.That having said, I'm a bit of an Argento fanboy and can't in all honesty recommend it to his fans, or... well, anyone else probably except fellow fanboys, but Dracula is very probably his weakest film, even if I preferred it to Giallo.",fear

Where the rock is splitand speaks to the water;     the flame speaks to the cloud;the red splatter, abstraction, on the doorspeaks to the angel and the constellations.The grains of sand on the sea-floor speak at last to the noon.And the loud hammering of the land behindspeaks ringing up the bones of our thighs, the hoofs,we hear the hoofs over the seethe of the sea. All night down the centuries, have heard, music of passage. Music of one child carried into the desert;firstborn forbidden by law of the pyramid.Drawn through the water with the water-drawn peopleled by the water-drawn man to the smoke mountain.The voice of the world speaking, the world covered by signs,the burning, the loving, the speaking, the opening.Strong throat of sound from the smoking mountain.Still flame, the spoken singing of a young child.The meaning beginning to move, which is the song. Music of those who have walked out of slavery. Into that journey where all things speak to all thingsrefusing to accept the curse, and takingfor signs the signs of all things, the world, the bodywhich is part of the soul, and speaks to the world,all creation being created in one image, creation.This is not the past walking into the future,the walk is painful, into the present, the dancenot visible as dance until much later.These dancers are discoverers of God. We knew we had all crossed over when we heard the song. Out of a life of building lack on lack:the slaves refusing slavery, escaping into faith:an army who came to the ocean: the walkerswho walked through the opposites, from I to opened Thou,city and cleave of the sea. Those at flaming Nauvoo,the ice on the great river: the escaping Negroes,swamp and wild city: the shivering children of Parisand the glass black hearses; those on the Long March:all those who together are the frontier, forehead of man. Where the wilderness enters, the world, the song of the world. Akiba rescued, secretly, in the clothes of deathby his disciples carried from Jerusalemin blackness journeying to find his journeyto whatever he was loving with his life.The wilderness journey through which we moveunder the whirlwind truth into the new,the only accurate. A cluster of lights at night:faces before the pillar of fire. A child watchingwhile the sea breaks open. This night. The way in. Barbarian music, a new song. Acknowledging opened water, possibility:open like a woman to this meaning.In a time of building statues of the stars,valuing certain partial ferocious skillswhile past us the chill and immense wildernessspreads its one-color wings until we knowrock, water, flame, cloud, or the floor of the sea,the world is a sign, a way of speaking.

But for most people who had already watched ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" have definitely harbored discriminatory feelings and complements for this action film.As far as action, adventure and fantasy is concerned, it was a good raw effort by J. Lee Thompson who had earlier two great feathers to his cap namely, ""The Guns of Navarone"" and ""MecKenna's Gold"".

At first it seems as if he may have taken a triple-dose of tranquilizers, but even this could not explain the dullness and lethargy of both character and performance - he must have had a Compazine intravenous drip disguised on his person during filming. And Mickey Rooney's character/performance are an insult, not only to the Japanese, but all persons of Oriental heritage. The insult is not due to parodying them, but in the awfulness of this portrayal. The performances of Holly's South American big-shot swain, and her estranged husband (by Buddy Ebsen) are also insipid and weak. (Ebsen's television Barnaby Jones' portrayal was Shakespearean by comparison.) The best performance, and most interesting character, here, are on the part of Holly's cat (named, unimaginatively, ""Cat""). This name demonstrates, again, the weakness of both film and character.

The entire plot not only  reminds you of the period when Sholay kind of movies portraying  friendship and love but actually makes you feel you are watching the  old movie in Sony or Zee TV on some lazy Sundays.   Plot: The plot is about two inseparable friends who became outlaws  because of their circumstances. They undergo the usual friendship, love  towards the same girl and betrayal finally becoming enemies and  patching up in the end. The plot also offers you a lot of twists and  turns according to the director most of which we find it or judge it in  the first 30 mins of the movie.  Casting: Arjun and Ranveer as the lead heroes played their roles  perfectly as coal hustlers. Irfan Khan as the commissioner of police  was not used so well in the movie. Priyanka Chopra as the lead heroine  comes as the only pleasant element to watch on screen stuns us with her  versatile looks in songs and scenes. Particularly after the hot steamy  item no in Ramleela she comes this time with the Moulin Rouge style  Cabaret dance no Assalaam Ishqun which she brought the real oomph  factor. Another song Jiya showed her as the Goddess of beauty with the  different hues in her dressing. Both songs I can say Paisa vasool in  terms of visual and music.

"This film is Dario Argento's take on the Dracula story, with more than a few detours from the traditional telling. Detours, sadly, that are never in a positive direction.I was first able to sit in for an advance screening of the film, but then everything went haywire about thirty minutes in. Even from that much, the evidence was clear that this was a disaster.We can safely say this is the low point of Argento's career. Although he has been declining since ""Sleepless"", if not earlier, this is the new low and I find it hard to believe such a low mark will ever be beaten. Not even Rutger Hauer and music from Claudio Simonetti can save this stinker.The dubbing is poor, the acting is weak and the film opens with a terrible special effects shot. I would describe what I saw as one notch up from the films that The Asylum makes -- and a very small notch at that! This does not instill confidence and I wish Argento would retire if he no longer has it in him, as his legacy is being tarnished.Since first writing this, I have seen the film in its entirety, and if anything, it gets worse. More terrible effects, a plot that plods along at a slow, tiresome pace... and what is the deal with the praying mantis?Again, while I appreciate having a score from Claudio Simonetti (and not a bad score, either), this cannot cover for such a terrible film. What Argento might consider ""sexy"" strikes me as simply gratuitous and without style. The reputation of Argento will be forever tarnished.",fear

"Between pond and sheepbarn, by maples and watery birches,Rebecca paces a double line of rustin a sandy trench, striding on blackcreosoted eight-by-eights.

You can see in her eyes that the villains will not get the upper hand.The more helpless she seems ,the stronger she is when danger comes around.Dumb but not dumb!

"Not so bad as expected this Dracula 3d. For sure the acting was rather wooden, the effects (specially the digital ones) looked cheap sometimes and the story was not mind blowing, but I very much liked the retro-look of this film. I had the opportunity to see this film on big screen, in 3D and I was kind of touched by its Hammerish-look. The photography, the use of colors, the set designs... it all reminded me of films that were made decades ago. Sweet memories. Might be a bit out of time for modern viewers, but if you can look through the bad acting and some cheesy effects, you actually find a film with a charming, nostalgically look.",fear
"Himesh Reshammiya is back with Karzzz and yet again as a Music Director, Singer and the main actor. In future he will be back as camera man, director, producer & even light man anyways this is truly awful movie, complete waste of time. As a singer in this movie he will be mostly well known for his god-awful nasal twang and 2) his fake wig! It looks as if he bought that wig from some cheap discount store in Bombay, Quite a deadly combo don't you think. However jokes apart. His nasal twang has become familiar in every household of India, is all set to torment the in this film Karzzzz. Watching Aap Ka Suroor was the biggest punishment and now he's in this movie again. If you are one of many, who think Himesh Reshammiya looks funny with his cap on then check him out without cap in this movie Karzzzz. I bet you will fall off your chair laughing. . Talking about his music his lyricist won't have to do a lot of computer work. When he's writing the lyrics on his computer, he can just write 'auuuuuu' or 'owwww' and then Ctrl+c and Ctrl+V it wherever fillers are required. Except for the a,e,i,o,u keys on his computer, the rest of the keys must be a little dusty. He came in a movie 'Aap ka suroor - the movi'ee'....that's how its spelt and now in Karzzzz I don't get it why they added 4 z's at last? to add more emotions or what ?? I do not know whether he uses pathetic instruments or what but u just consider the opening music of the song ""Lut Jaaon Lut Jaaon"" its such a crap I mean it defines the word crap. Some argue that Himesh has had several hits but when he sings then it's like a car coming to a screeching halt. Terrible comparison there? He sounds loud, nasal, sometimes feels like crying while singing and other times makes you wonder why is he singing. God gave us nose for breathing not for singing and I personally think he is friend of Osama....he also torture innocent people and himesh also torture innocent people. Only difference is that himesh torture with his songs.... USA has taken action on Osama but we can't take any action against him...only we could do that just close your ears by your hands....Personally I look for music that has a certain amount of shelf-life. Unfortunately none of his albums have a good shelf-life of say beyond a month. If I have to go and buy an album, I'd much rather prefer an AR Rehman to Himesh Reshammiya. If you reading this himesh then concentrate on your music only and take some classes from AR Rehman or else stop giving music.Actually himesh should change his profession because singing is not the bed of roses..",fear
"I really wanted to like this film. I've seen so many bad Audrey Hepburn movies that I was aching for this ""classic"" to come through. Regrettably, it failed.The picture is very dated. The party scene alone is one long eye-roller, as the script tries to depict the swingin' sixties. Hepburn is, of course, stunningly gorgeous throughout the film, but, as in every other picture I've seen with her in it, the picture relies on her outer qualities to carry an otherwise mediocre (& even bad) film. There are moments of charm, pathos, and fun, but the overall effect is one where we're supposed to just like the movie because it's in love with itself.I can't help but wonder what would've happened if Hepburn had been born early enough to have been in pictures in the 30s and 40s, where women's roles were much stronger and complex. The 1960s and 70s were real wastelands as far as women's roles go. Many of the great stars of an earlier generation turned to the ""legitimate"" theatre for engaging roles worthy of their talents. I'd also love to see Hepburn destroy her own myth by appearing as torn-up as possible -- a little grunge monster like Elizabeth Taylor in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolfe?"".The other actors in the film are barely worth mentioning. Mickey Rooney's turn is simply embarrassing. Patricia Neal plays her part well but George Peppard is barely tolerable. The extreme close-ups of Buddy Ebsen seem inserted only to contrast with Hepburn's beauty -- again, detracting from the story.Note to self: don't bother seeing this one again unless you need a quick fix of Givenchy gowns.",fear

We’re going to Paradise.”IV.On the Road to ParadiseDistances don’t matternor the roll of the road past walnut groves.It’s sky that counts,the color of it at dawn or sunset,a match more true to the peachthan a mix of oils by Matisse.Or maybe it’s actually the weatherwe love most, the way it shiftsand scatters over the statelike radio waves bouncing off the face of the moon.The one over there, near Yuba City,rising over a backyard gardenof onions, tomatoes, squash, and corn.The one with the spiderscrambling through celery,harvesting moths and mayfliesfrom the web it has strung between stalks.Sometimes I wish I could harvest the weather,reap it like wheat or rice,store it in a siloannouncing steady rain or clear skies on its sides.When the prices rise,I could ship hailstorms or Santanas in orange crates,make Safeway go broke,do something politically efficacious for a change.But all I really do besides write these poemsis allow my mind to wander while I drive.There it goes, down the arroyo,through manzanita and Mormon tea.Or there, up the mustard and Indian pipe on the hill.Might as well let it.Nothing but God and Country on the radio now.Wolfman Jack’s syndicated and the Dodgershaven’t made it to Vero Beach.I wish this road would turn or bend,intersect with a spy movie some Spanish galleon,or maybe a Chinese poem with landscapesin brocade, mist, wine, and moonlight.This California moon is yellow most of the time,like it was stained with nicotine,or sealed in amber like an insect.Why is it always better somewhere else?Why do I always wish I were Tu Fu?V.Palmistry Fantasia There, the pasteboard and neon hand!Just past the interchange by the bowling alley.The one with silver rockets, small green stars,and a trail of red comets flashing through the smog.It’s still here, the handheld up in greeting or command.“Halt!” it says, or“Peace be with you, brother,”while the map across its palmtraces excursions into blue trees,green skies, and mushroom-colored lives.Blue dun is the color of its neon,the same as the throat feathers of a tealscudding over the marshes of Merced.It matches the purple mascara the gypsy woman wears,matches the pools of velvet-blue darkness in her eyes.Her name is Alma Josephina,and she designed the sign herself,imitating the figure of her own hand,the neon indicative of its natural aura.That was twenty years agowhen Eisenhower was Presidentand all her customers wore pedal pushersor Bermudas, and never noticedthe fireflies in the marshes at night.                           *You’re Oriental, aren’t you?Can you read tea leaves?I tried to once, years ago,had a Chinese woman teaching me,but her fees were too steep.I like a joke.It loosens up the customers.Well, come here towards the light.Let me get a good lookat the ghosts in the grave of your palm.They’re there, you know.All the people you’ve ever been,all the trips you’ve takenand the towns you’ve settled in,back before the birth of Christ,back before people were people,before this paw was a hand.You see?   The whole palm glowslike purple mist over a cemetery.Move closer.   Clamp it around the glass.See it flare on the inside?That’s the light your bones make,not the crystal at all.Look at your hand now.You can see yourself dancingon the heel just above the wrist.You must be a happy man.You’ll be born again and again,get to the threshold of Heaven,never enter but keep coming back,here, for fun, for friends,until this will be Paradise,and Paradise just an old resortthe highway’s passed by.Well, have a nice trip.You’ll make it yet.Says so right in that curvy linearound the Mound of Venus,that thumbstump there,right where the long straight linecuts across like an interstate.VI.Postcards Sent Home1.   Dust rolls out of the hills like fog,and it’s too hot for shoes or shirts.I’d like to take my hair off too,peel it from my head, dip it in a bucket of ice,and wear it around my neck like a bandana.2.Crickets attend the night,add a falsetto droneto the sound of uspissing in the tumbleweeds.3.   There’s a Tastee-Freeze in Fresno,A & Dub’s closed down,Jack-in-the-Box keeps popping up,and McDonald’s owns the town.4.   Somebody’s drying tobacco leaveson the laundry line.There, see them furland flap next to the nylons?5.A giant oak uncurls over the road,sprinkles a fine yellow powder on the windshield.The sun hits, touches it offin a spasm of golden-red light.VII.Body & Fender/Body & SoulAt the grill, the Indian girl with buckteeth and dimples serves us a roundof coffee and sweet rolls. We’re waiting for the guy at Henley’s Texaco,down the street, to find us a fan belt that’ll fit.   It’s early, the sky’s still inthe john, shaving, and the sports page has to wait to get in. Everybody’sgrumpy. We sit around, jab at raisins with our forks, and try to look astough as the waitresss.                           Her name’s Rita. Her brothers jump fires and pumpoil in Alaska. Her sisters string beads and make babies back on the Res.Her ex is white, a logger who threatened never to come back and didn’t.She doesn’t hold any grudges. That’s why she’s so nice, why she pops hergum filling the salt and pepper shakers, why she adjusts her girdle so wecan see, why the egg spot on her dress doesn’t show.                                                                                          Outside, the sun eases up overthe parking lot, scrambles across the freeway, and runs for cover behind apile of pumpkin-colored clouds. 99 starts shuffling its deck of cars andpickups, getting set to deal a hand of nine-to-five stud. We don’t watch.   This is Redding, and ain’t nothing thing going on besides the day shift.                                             Alan says, “Look, there’s Venus,” andpoints to a piece of light draining the sky. I want to order a country-fried steak, talk about the Dodgers, but there isn’t time. Lawson hums afew chords, stirring the changes with his coffee spoon.                                                                                                   Rita cruises back likea bus bound for Reno, starts dealing some ashtrays. She says, “How’s itgoing boys?”               I answer for all of us—“Hey, Rita. It’s almost gone.”VIII.Pilgrimage to the ShrineSix hours sincethe Paradise Cutoffand running on empty.No gas stations or rest stops,no weigh station, no cops.Just miles of straight roadand a long double-yellowunrolling in front of us.Alan recognized nothing.Lawson pops the glove,pulls out a penlight,and fingers the map,pronouncing a few mantras.Our headlights slideover a scarecrowmade of tumbleweedsstanding by the road.He’s wearing a kimono,a dark-blue stovepipe hat,his shoulders cloakedin a wreath of chrysanthemums.We pull over,back up,and he disappearsinto the pale-grey darkness.It’s smoke.We can smell it,so somebody’sgot to beclose by.But our eyesgo blined, fillwith tears and ashesas we stumbledown the off-ramp.The smell offrying troutand steamed ricereaches us whenwe come to.An old hermit,dressed like the scarecrow,crawls out of his barracksand brings us tea.“Drink!” he says,“It’ll pick you up!”And so we drink,feeling drugged.Soft bluesin the keyof sleepsuffocates the air.From up the mountain,the sound of obsidian,flaking in the wind.Clouds of black glasswaltz around us.We dress ourselvesin shrouds of tule reedsstitched with barbed wire,stained with salt and mud.We refuse to cry.We drift backto the highway,holding our fistslike rattles,shaking themlike bones.IX.Confessions of the Highway/The Hermit SpeaksI know the rituals, the spells of grapes,the ceremonies of tomatoes, celery, and rice.I know the color of wind dressed for fiesta,and the names of carnivals in Spanish and Japanese.I am familiar with the determination of campesinoswho migrate up and down the stretch of the statein search of crops ready for harvest.It’s all a dull ache in my back,small cuts on the throats of my fingers,and the alkali of a dry lake in my lungs.For me, the oracle of the giant orangealways predicts good fortune,yet, it never comes true.My stomach is full of sand and tar,a little bit of paint, a few crickets.I stand in swampwater up to my hips,and the stink of rotting figsescapes my armpits in small brown clouds.Scrub oak and tumbleweed sprout from my scalp,make a small grove behind my left ear.I don’t know why sparrows and starlingsrefuse to approach me, to take the grass seedtucked in the cuffs of my trousers.Maybe it’s the stain of asphalt around my ankles,this copper sheen of sweat on my back.Sometimes, when the valley heatmakes the bones in my feetstart to hiss and burn,the desire to escape comes over me again.I can’t help it.My arms pull down a few telephone posts,my shoulders churn against the bindings.I feel myself wanting to sit up,begin to walk again, and thresh my wayacross rice fields and acres of alfalfa.For once I’d like to lift my facestraight above Shasta into the sky,shout in unison with thunder,roar with the assurance of Santana wind,leap out of these bonds of copper and steel,slough off this skin of cement,and walk south or north or even westinto the weather and the sea.",fear

"To the Memory of the Household It Describes  This Poem is Dedicated by the Author  “As the Spirits of Darkness be stronger in the dark, so Good Spirits, which be Angels of Light, are augmented not only by the Divine light of the Sun, but also by our common Wood Fire: and as the Celestial Fire drives away dark spirits, so also this our Fire of Wood doth the same.” —Cor. Agrippa, Occult Philosophy, Book I.ch. v.   “Announced by all the trumpets of the sky,  Arrives the snow, and, driving o’er the fields,  Seems nowhere to alight: the whited air  Hides hills and woods, the river and the heaven,  And veils the farm-house at the garden’s end.  The sled and traveller stopped, the courier’s feet  Delayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit  Around the radiant fireplace, enclosed  In a tumultuous privacy of Storm.”  EMERSON, The Snow Storm.The sun that brief December day Rose cheerless over hills of gray, And, darkly circled, gave at noon A sadder light than waning moon. Slow tracing down the thickening sky Its mute and ominous prophecy, A portent seeming less than threat, It sank from sight before it set. A chill no coat, however stout, Of homespun stuff could quite shut out, A hard, dull bitterness of cold, That checked, mid-vein, the circling race Of life-blood in the sharpened face, The coming of the snow-storm told. The wind blew east; we heard the roar Of Ocean on his wintry shore, And felt the strong pulse throbbing there Beat with low rhythm our inland air. Meanwhile we did our nightly chores,— Brought in the wood from out of doors, Littered the stalls, and from the mows Raked down the herd’s-grass for the cows; Heard the horse whinnying for his corn; And, sharply clashing horn on horn, Impatient down the stanchion rows The cattle shake their walnut bows; While, peering from his early perch Upon the scaffold’s pole of birch, The cock his crested helmet bent And down his querulous challenge sent. Unwarmed by any sunset light The gray day darkened into night, A night made hoary with the swarm And whirl-dance of the blinding storm, As zigzag, wavering to and fro, Crossed and recrossed the wingëd snow: And ere the early bedtime came The white drift piled the window-frame, And through the glass the clothes-line posts Looked in like tall and sheeted ghosts. So all night long the storm roared on: The morning broke without a sun; In tiny spherule traced with lines Of Nature’s geometric signs, In starry flake, and pellicle, All day the hoary meteor fell; And, when the second morning shone, We looked upon a world unknown, On nothing we could call our own. Around the glistening wonder bent The blue walls of the firmament, No cloud above, no earth below,— A universe of sky and snow! The old familiar sights of ours Took marvellous shapes; strange domes and towers Rose up where sty or corn-crib stood, Or garden-wall, or belt of wood; A smooth white mound the brush-pile showed, A fenceless drift what once was road; The bridle-post an old man sat With loose-flung coat and high cocked hat; The well-curb had a Chinese roof; And even the long sweep, high aloof, In its slant splendor, seemed to tell Of Pisa’s leaning miracle. A prompt, decisive man, no breath Our father wasted: “Boys, a path!” Well pleased, (for when did farmer boy Count such a summons less than joy?) Our buskins on our feet we drew; With mittened hands, and caps drawn low, To guard our necks and ears from snow, We cut the solid whiteness through. And, where the drift was deepest, made A tunnel walled and overlaid With dazzling crystal: we had read Of rare Aladdin’s wondrous cave, And to our own his name we gave, With many a wish the luck were ours To test his lamp’s supernal powers. We reached the barn with merry din, And roused the prisoned brutes within. The old horse thrust his long head out, And grave with wonder gazed about; The cock his lusty greeting said, And forth his speckled harem led; The oxen lashed their tails, and hooked, And mild reproach of hunger looked; The hornëd patriarch of the sheep, Like Egypt’s Amun roused from sleep, Shook his sage head with gesture mute, And emphasized with stamp of foot. All day the gusty north-wind bore The loosening drift its breath before; Low circling round its southern zone, The sun through dazzling snow-mist shone. No church-bell lent its Christian tone To the savage air, no social smoke Curled over woods of snow-hung oak. A solitude made more intense By dreary-voicëd elements, The shrieking of the mindless wind, The moaning tree-boughs swaying blind, And on the glass the unmeaning beat Of ghostly finger-tips of sleet. Beyond the circle of our hearth No welcome sound of toil or mirth Unbound the spell, and testified Of human life and thought outside. We minded that the sharpest ear The buried brooklet could not hear, The music of whose liquid lip Had been to us companionship, And, in our lonely life, had grown To have an almost human tone. As night drew on, and, from the crest Of wooded knolls that ridged the west, The sun, a snow-blown traveller, sank From sight beneath the smothering bank, We piled, with care, our nightly stack Of wood against the chimney-back,— The oaken log, green, huge, and thick, And on its top the stout back-stick; The knotty forestick laid apart, And filled between with curious art The ragged brush; then, hovering near, We watched the first red blaze appear, Heard the sharp crackle, caught the gleam On whitewashed wall and sagging beam, Until the old, rude-furnished room Burst, flower-like, into rosy bloom; While radiant with a mimic flame Outside the sparkling drift became, And through the bare-boughed lilac-tree Our own warm hearth seemed blazing free. The crane and pendent trammels showed, The Turks’ heads on the andirons glowed; While childish fancy, prompt to tell The meaning of the miracle, Whispered the old rhyme: “Under the tree, When fire outdoors burns merrily, There the witches are making tea.” The moon above the eastern wood Shone at its full; the hill-range stood Transfigured in the silver flood, Its blown snows flashing cold and keen, Dead white, save where some sharp ravine Took shadow, or the sombre green Of hemlocks turned to pitchy black Against the whiteness at their back. For such a world and such a night Most fitting that unwarming light, Which only seemed where’er it fell To make the coldness visible. Shut in from all the world without, We sat the clean-winged hearth about, Content to let the north-wind roar In baffled rage at pane and door, While the red logs before us beat The frost-line back with tropic heat; And ever, when a louder blast Shook beam and rafter as it passed, The merrier up its roaring draught The great throat of the chimney laughed; The house-dog on his paws outspread Laid to the fire his drowsy head, The cat’s dark silhouette on the wall A couchant tiger’s seemed to fall; And, for the winter fireside meet, Between the andirons’ straddling feet, The mug of cider simmered slow, The apples sputtered in a row, And, close at hand, the basket stood With nuts from brown October’s wood. What matter how the night behaved? What matter how the north-wind raved? Blow high, blow low, not all its snow Could quench our hearth-fire’s ruddy glow. O Time and Change!—with hair as gray As was my sire’s that winter day, How strange it seems, with so much gone Of life and love, to still live on! Ah, brother! only I and thou Are left of all that circle now,— The dear home faces whereupon That fitful firelight paled and shone. Henceforward, listen as we will, The voices of that hearth are still; Look where we may, the wide earth o’er, Those lighted faces smile no more. We tread the paths their feet have worn,       We sit beneath their orchard trees,       We hear, like them, the hum of bees And rustle of the bladed corn; We turn the pages that they read,       Their written words we linger o’er, But in the sun they cast no shade, No voice is heard, no sign is made,       No step is on the conscious floor! Yet love will dream, and Faith will trust, (Since He who knows our need is just,) That somehow, somewhere, meet we must. Alas for him who never sees The stars shine through his cypress-trees! Who, hopeless, lays his dead away, Nor looks to see the breaking day Across the mournful marbles play! Who hath not learned, in hours of faith,       The truth to flesh and sense unknown, That Life is ever lord of Death,       And love can never lose its own! We sped the time with stories old, Wrought puzzles out, and riddles told, Or stammered from our school-book lore “The Chief of Gambia’s golden shore.” How often since, when all the land Was clay in Slavery’s shaping hand, As if a far-blown trumpet stirred The languorous sin-sick air, I heard: “Does not the voice of reason cry,       Claim the first right which Nature gave, From the red scourge of bondage to fly,       Nor deign to live a burdened slave!“ Our father rode again his ride On Memphremagog’s wooded side; Sat down again to moose and samp In trapper’s hut and Indian camp; Lived o’er the old idyllic ease Beneath St. François’ hemlock-trees; Again for him the moonlight shone On Norman cap and bodiced zone; Again he heard the violin play Which led the village dance away. And mingled in its merry whirl The grandam and the laughing girl. Or, nearer home, our steps he led Where Salisbury’s level marshes spread       Mile-wide as flies the laden bee; Where merry mowers, hale and strong, Swept, scythe on scythe, their swaths along       The low green prairies of the sea. We shared the fishing off Boar’s Head,       And round the rocky Isles of Shoals       The hake-broil on the drift-wood coals; The chowder on the sand-beach made, Dipped by the hungry, steaming hot, With spoons of clam-shell from the pot. We heard the tales of witchcraft old, And dream and sign and marvel told To sleepy listeners as they lay Stretched idly on the salted hay, Adrift along the winding shores, When favoring breezes deigned to blow The square sail of the gundelow And idle lay the useless oars. Our mother, while she turned her wheel Or run the new-knit stocking-heel, Told how the Indian hordes came down At midnight on Concheco town, And how her own great-uncle bore His cruel scalp-mark to fourscore. Recalling, in her fitting phrase,       So rich and picturesque and free       (The common unrhymed poetry Of simple life and country ways,) The story of her early days,— She made us welcome to her home; Old hearths grew wide to give us room; We stole with her a frightened look At the gray wizard’s conjuring-book, The fame whereof went far and wide Through all the simple country side; We heard the hawks at twilight play, The boat-horn on Piscataqua, The loon’s weird laughter far away; We fished her little trout-brook, knew What flowers in wood and meadow grew, What sunny hillsides autumn-brown She climbed to shake the ripe nuts down, Saw where in sheltered cove and bay, The ducks’ black squadron anchored lay, And heard the wild-geese calling loud Beneath the gray November cloud. Then, haply, with a look more grave, And soberer tone, some tale she gave From painful Sewel’s ancient tome, Beloved in every Quaker home, Of faith fire-winged by martyrdom, Or Chalkley’s Journal, old and quaint,— Gentlest of skippers, rare sea-saint!— Who, when the dreary calms prevailed, And water-butt and bread-cask failed, And cruel, hungry eyes pursued His portly presence mad for food, With dark hints muttered under breath Of casting lots for life or death, Offered, if Heaven withheld supplies, To be himself the sacrifice. Then, suddenly, as if to save The good man from his living grave, A ripple on the water grew, A school of porpoise flashed in view. “Take, eat,” he said, “and be content; These fishes in my stead are sent By Him who gave the tangled ram To spare the child of Abraham.” Our uncle, innocent of books, Was rich in lore of fields and brooks, The ancient teachers never dumb Of Nature’s unhoused lyceum. In moons and tides and weather wise, He read the clouds as prophecies, And foul or fair could well divine, By many an occult hint and sign, Holding the cunning-warded keys To all the woodcraft mysteries; Himself to Nature’s heart so near That all her voices in his ear Of beast or bird had meanings clear, Like Apollonius of old, Who knew the tales the sparrows told, Or Hermes, who interpreted What the sage cranes of Nilus said; A simple, guileless, childlike man, Content to live where life began; Strong only on his native grounds, The little world of sights and sounds Whose girdle was the parish bounds, Whereof his fondly partial pride The common features magnified, As Surrey hills to mountains grew In White of Selborne’s loving view,— He told how teal and loon he shot, And how the eagle’s eggs he got, The feats on pond and river done, The prodigies of rod and gun; Till, warming with the tales he told, Forgotten was the outside cold, The bitter wind unheeded blew, From ripening corn the pigeons flew, The partridge drummed i’ the wood, the mink Went fishing down the river-brink. In fields with bean or clover gay, The woodchuck, like a hermit gray,       Peered from the doorway of his cell; The muskrat plied the mason’s trade, And tier by tier his mud-walls laid; And from the shagbark overhead       The grizzled squirrel dropped his shell. Next, the dear aunt, whose smile of cheer And voice in dreams I see and hear,— The sweetest woman ever Fate Perverse denied a household mate, Who, lonely, homeless, not the less Found peace in love’s unselfishness, And welcome wheresoe’er she went, A calm and gracious element, Whose presence seemed the sweet income And womanly atmosphere of home,— Called up her girlhood memories, The huskings and the apple-bees, The sleigh-rides and the summer sails, Weaving through all the poor details And homespun warp of circumstance A golden woof-thread of romance. For well she kept her genial mood And simple faith of maidenhood; Before her still a cloud-land lay, The mirage loomed across her way; The morning dew, that dries so soon With others, glistened at her noon; Through years of toil and soil and care, From glossy tress to thin gray hair, All unprofaned she held apart The virgin fancies of the heart. Be shame to him of woman born Who hath for such but thought of scorn. There, too, our elder sister plied Her evening task the stand beside; A full, rich nature, free to trust, Truthful and almost sternly just, Impulsive, earnest, prompt to act, And make her generous thought a fact, Keeping with many a light disguise The secret of self-sacrifice. O heart sore-tried! thou hast the best That Heaven itself could give thee,—rest, Rest from all bitter thoughts and things!       How many a poor one’s blessing went       With thee beneath the low green tent Whose curtain never outward swings! As one who held herself a part Of all she saw, and let her heart       Against the household bosom lean, Upon the motley-braided mat Our youngest and our dearest sat, Lifting her large, sweet, asking eyes,    Now bathed in the unfading green And holy peace of Paradise. Oh, looking from some heavenly hill,       Or from the shade of saintly palms,       Or silver reach of river calms, Do those large eyes behold me still? With me one little year ago:— The chill weight of the winter snow       For months upon her grave has lain; And now, when summer south-winds blow       And brier and harebell bloom again, I tread the pleasant paths we trod, I see the violet-sprinkled sod Whereon she leaned, too frail and weak The hillside flowers she loved to seek, Yet following me where’er I went With dark eyes full of love’s content. The birds are glad; the brier-rose fills The air with sweetness; all the hills Stretch green to June’s unclouded sky; But still I wait with ear and eye For something gone which should be nigh, A loss in all familiar things, In flower that blooms, and bird that sings. And yet, dear heart! remembering thee,       Am I not richer than of old? Safe in thy immortality,       What change can reach the wealth I hold?       What chance can mar the pearl and gold Thy love hath left in trust with me? And while in life’s late afternoon,       Where cool and long the shadows grow, I walk to meet the night that soon       Shall shape and shadow overflow, I cannot feel that thou art far, Since near at need the angels are; And when the sunset gates unbar,       Shall I not see thee waiting stand, And, white against the evening star,       The welcome of thy beckoning hand? Brisk wielder of the birch and rule, The master of the district school Held at the fire his favored place, Its warm glow lit a laughing face Fresh-hued and fair, where scarce appeared The uncertain prophecy of beard. He teased the mitten-blinded cat, Played cross-pins on my uncle’s hat, Sang songs, and told us what befalls In classic Dartmouth’s college halls. Born the wild Northern hills among, From whence his yeoman father wrung By patient toil subsistence scant, Not competence and yet not want, He early gained the power to pay His cheerful, self-reliant way; Could doff at ease his scholar’s gown To peddle wares from town to town; Or through the long vacation’s reach In lonely lowland districts teach, Where all the droll experience found At stranger hearths in boarding round, The moonlit skater’s keen delight, The sleigh-drive through the frosty night, The rustic party, with its rough Accompaniment of blind-man’s-buff, And whirling-plate, and forfeits paid, His winter task a pastime made. Happy the snow-locked homes wherein He tuned his merry violin, Or played the athlete in the barn, Or held the good dame’s winding-yarn, Or mirth-provoking versions told Of classic legends rare and old, Wherein the scenes of Greece and Rome Had all the commonplace of home, And little seemed at best the odds ’Twixt Yankee pedlers and old gods; Where Pindus-born Arachthus took The guise of any grist-mill brook, And dread Olympus at his will Became a huckleberry hill. A careless boy that night he seemed;       But at his desk he had the look And air of one who wisely schemed,       And hostage from the future took       In trainëd thought and lore of book. Large-brained, clear-eyed, of such as he Shall Freedom’s young apostles be, Who, following in War’s bloody trail, Shall every lingering wrong assail; All chains from limb and spirit strike, Uplift the black and white alike; Scatter before their swift advance The darkness and the ignorance, The pride, the lust, the squalid sloth, Which nurtured Treason’s monstrous growth, Made murder pastime, and the hell Of prison-torture possible; The cruel lie of caste refute, Old forms remould, and substitute For Slavery’s lash the freeman’s will, For blind routine, wise-handed skill; A school-house plant on every hill, Stretching in radiate nerve-lines thence The quick wires of intelligence; Till North and South together brought Shall own the same electric thought, In peace a common flag salute, And, side by side in labor’s free And unresentful rivalry, Harvest the fields wherein they fought. Another guest that winter night Flashed back from lustrous eyes the light. Unmarked by time, and yet not young, The honeyed music of her tongue And words of meekness scarcely told A nature passionate and bold, Strong, self-concentred, spurning guide, Its milder features dwarfed beside Her unbent will’s majestic pride. She sat among us, at the best, A not unfeared, half-welcome guest, Rebuking with her cultured phrase Our homeliness of words and ways. A certain pard-like, treacherous grace Swayed the lithe limbs and drooped the lash, Lent the white teeth their dazzling flash; And under low brows, black with night, Rayed out at times a dangerous light; The sharp heat-lightnings of her face Presaging ill to him whom Fate Condemned to share her love or hate. A woman tropical, intense In thought and act, in soul and sense, She blended in a like degree The vixen and the devotee, Revealing with each freak or feint       The temper of Petruchio’s Kate, The raptures of Siena’s saint. Her tapering hand and rounded wrist Had facile power to form a fist; The warm, dark languish of her eyes Was never safe from wrath’s surprise. Brows saintly calm and lips devout Knew every change of scowl and pout; And the sweet voice had notes more high And shrill for social battle-cry. Since then what old cathedral town Has missed her pilgrim staff and gown, What convent-gate has held its lock Against the challenge of her knock! Through Smyrna’s plague-hushed thoroughfares, Up sea-set Malta’s rocky stairs, Gray olive slopes of hills that hem Thy tombs and shrines, Jerusalem, Or startling on her desert throne The crazy Queen of Lebanon With claims fantastic as her own, Her tireless feet have held their way; And still, unrestful, bowed, and gray, She watches under Eastern skies,       With hope each day renewed and fresh,       The Lord’s quick coming in the flesh, Whereof she dreams and prophesies! Where’er her troubled path may be,       The Lord’s sweet pity with her go! The outward wayward life we see,       The hidden springs we may not know. Nor is it given us to discern       What threads the fatal sisters spun,       Through what ancestral years has run The sorrow with the woman born, What forged her cruel chain of moods, What set her feet in solitudes, And held the love within her mute, What mingled madness in the blood,       A life-long discord and annoy,       Water of tears with oil of joy, And hid within the folded bud       Perversities of flower and fruit. It is not ours to separate The tangled skein of will and fate, To show what metes and bounds should stand Upon the soul’s debatable land, And between choice and Providence Divide the circle of events; But He who knows our frame is just, Merciful and compassionate, And full of sweet assurances And hope for all the language is, That He remembereth we are dust! At last the great logs, crumbling low, Sent out a dull and duller glow, The bull’s-eye watch that hung in view, Ticking its weary circuit through, Pointed with mutely warning sign Its black hand to the hour of nine. That sign the pleasant circle broke: My uncle ceased his pipe to smoke, Knocked from its bowl the refuse gray, And laid it tenderly away; Then roused himself to safely cover The dull red brands with ashes over. And while, with care, our mother laid The work aside, her steps she stayed One moment, seeking to express Her grateful sense of happiness For food and shelter, warmth and health, And love’s contentment more than wealth, With simple wishes (not the weak, Vain prayers which no fulfilment seek, But such as warm the generous heart, O’er-prompt to do with Heaven its part) That none might lack, that bitter night, For bread and clothing, warmth and light. Within our beds awhile we heard The wind that round the gables roared, With now and then a ruder shock, Which made our very bedsteads rock. We heard the loosened clapboards tost, The board-nails snapping in the frost; And on us, through the unplastered wall, Felt the light sifted snow-flakes fall. But sleep stole on, as sleep will do When hearts are light and life is new; Faint and more faint the murmurs grew, Till in the summer-land of dreams They softened to the sound of streams, Low stir of leaves, and dip of oars, And lapsing waves on quiet shores. Next morn we wakened with the shout Of merry voices high and clear; And saw the teamsters drawing near To break the drifted highways out. Down the long hillside treading slow We saw the half-buried oxen go, Shaking the snow from heads uptost, Their straining nostrils white with frost. Before our door the straggling train Drew up, an added team to gain. The elders threshed their hands a-cold,       Passed, with the cider-mug, their jokes       From lip to lip; the younger folks Down the loose snow-banks, wrestling, rolled, Then toiled again the cavalcade       O’er windy hill, through clogged ravine,       And woodland paths that wound between Low drooping pine-boughs winter-weighed. From every barn a team afoot, At every house a new recruit, Where, drawn by Nature’s subtlest law, Haply the watchful young men saw Sweet doorway pictures of the curls And curious eyes of merry girls, Lifting their hands in mock defence Against the snow-ball’s compliments, And reading in each missive tost The charm with Eden never lost. We heard once more the sleigh-bells’ sound;       And, following where the teamsters led, The wise old Doctor went his round, Just pausing at our door to say, In the brief autocratic way Of one who, prompt at Duty’s call, Was free to urge her claim on all,       That some poor neighbor sick abed At night our mother’s aid would need. For, one in generous thought and deed,       What mattered in the sufferer’s sight       The Quaker matron’s inward light, The Doctor’s mail of Calvin’s creed? All hearts confess the saints elect       Who, twain in faith, in love agree, And melt not in an acid sect       The Christian pearl of charity! So days went on: a week had passed Since the great world was heard from last. The Almanac we studied o’er, Read and reread our little store Of books and pamphlets, scarce a score; One harmless novel, mostly hid From younger eyes, a book forbid, And poetry, (or good or bad, A single book was all we had,) Where Ellwood’s meek, drab-skirted Muse,       A stranger to the heathen Nine,       Sang, with a somewhat nasal whine, The wars of David and the Jews. At last the floundering carrier bore The village paper to our door. Lo! broadening outward as we read, To warmer zones the horizon spread In panoramic length unrolled We saw the marvels that it told. Before us passed the painted Creeks,       And daft McGregor on his raids       In Costa Rica’s everglades. And up Taygetos winding slow Rode Ypsilanti’s Mainote Greeks, A Turk’s head at each saddle-bow! Welcome to us its week-old news, Its corner for the rustic Muse,       Its monthly gauge of snow and rain, Its record, mingling in a breath The wedding bell and dirge of death: Jest, anecdote, and love-lorn tale, The latest culprit sent to jail; Its hue and cry of stolen and lost, Its vendue sales and goods at cost,       And traffic calling loud for gain. We felt the stir of hall and street, The pulse of life that round us beat; The chill embargo of the snow Was melted in the genial glow; Wide swung again our ice-locked door, And all the world was ours once more! Clasp, Angel of the backword look       And folded wings of ashen gray       And voice of echoes far away, The brazen covers of thy book; The weird palimpsest old and vast, Wherein thou hid’st the spectral past; Where, closely mingling, pale and glow The characters of joy and woe; The monographs of outlived years, Or smile-illumed or dim with tears,       Green hills of life that slope to death, And haunts of home, whose vistaed trees Shade off to mournful cypresses       With the white amaranths underneath. Even while I look, I can but heed       The restless sands’ incessant fall, Importunate hours that hours succeed, Each clamorous with its own sharp need,       And duty keeping pace with all. Shut down and clasp with heavy lids; I hear again the voice that bids The dreamer leave his dream midway For larger hopes and graver fears: Life greatens in these later years, The century’s aloe flowers to-day! Yet, haply, in some lull of life, Some Truce of God which breaks its strife, The worldling’s eyes shall gather dew,       Dreaming in throngful city ways Of winter joys his boyhood knew; And dear and early friends—the few Who yet remain—shall pause to view       These Flemish pictures of old days; Sit with me by the homestead hearth, And stretch the hands of memory forth       To warm them at the wood-fire’s blaze! And thanks untraced to lips unknown Shall greet me like the odors blown From unseen meadows newly mown, Or lilies floating in some pond, Wood-fringed, the wayside gaze beyond; The traveller owns the grateful sense Of sweetness near, he knows not whence, And, pausing, takes with forehead bare The benediction of the air.",fear

"There were no road rails.I remember no road rails and the death depth off the cliffswe motored along.I remember speed in a parched Chevy clunker that could not have sped,and bench seats, and no buckles, and bare thighs peeling off faux leatherat every hairpin.

"Overall, this is entertaining and well done. The effects are not revolutionary but at least fit in to the story rather than detract from it. No violence or mayhem - its OK for a younger to general audience. Main fault is the hero Dave played by Jay Baruchel isn't up to the part.The script is pleasant if predictable - does the nerd hero rise to the task and vanquish the evil forces. There could have been more historical witches besides Abigail Williams of Salem. There are some humorous bits but not too many.Acting is better than expected. Nicholas Cage is quite good more serious and less horsey than usual. Monica looks a little older and has too little screen time. Alfred Molina is convincing without being annoying. Alice Krige (Morgana) is good and looks young. Teresa Palmer (Becky) the girlfriend acts and looks like a blonde Kristen Stewart.The main problem is Jay Baruchel (Dave) is a too geeky to the point of spastic sometimes. It is painful to watch him. He lacks charm and charisma nerdy or otherwise. He is not a cute geek. He speaks like he has a speech impediment. Would have been better with someone more like Shia Labeouf, Justin Long or Michael Angarano if they wanted one of the new nerd/geek heroes.",fear

"A name trimmed            They    are   seated   in    the   shadowswith colored                     husking   corn, shelling   peas. Housesribbons                              of wood set in the   ground.   I try to                                            find the spot at which the pattern on                                                           the   floor   repeats.   Pink,   and rosy,                                            quartz. They   wade   in brackish water.                                            The    leaves    outside    the window   tricked the eye, demanding that one see them, focus on them,   making it impossible to   look   past   them, and though holes   were opened through the foliage, they were as useless as port-  holes underwater looking into a dark sea, which only reflects   the room one seeks to look out from. Sometimes into   benevolent and other times into ghastly shapes. It speaks of a   few of the rather terrible blind. I grew stubborn until blue as   the eyes overlooking the bay from the bridge scattered over   its bowls through a fading light and backed by the protest of   the bright breathless West. Each bit of jello had been molded   in tiny doll dishes, each trembling orange bit a different   shape, but all otherwise the same. I am urged out rummaging   into the sunshine, and the depths increase of blue above. A   paper hat afloat on a cone of water. The orange and gray   bugs were linked from their mating but faced in opposite   directions, and their scrambling amounted to nothing. This   simply means that the imagination is more restless than the   body. But, already, words. Can there be laughter without   comparisons. The tongue lisps in its hilarious panic. If, for ex-   ample, you say, “I always prefer being by myself,”   and, then,   one afternoon, you want to telephone a friend, maybe you   feel you have betrayed your ideals. We have poured into the   sink the stale water in which the iris died. Life is hopelessly   frayed, all loose ends. A pansy suddenly, a web, a trail   remarkably’s a snail’s. It was an enormous egg, sitting in the   vineyard—an enormous rock-shaped egg. On that still day   my grandmother raked up the leaves beside a particular   pelargonium. With a name like that there is a lot you can do.   Children are not always inclined to choose such paths. You   can tell by the eucalyptus tree, its shaggy branches scatter   buttons. In the afternoons, when the shades were pulled for   my nap, the light coming through was of a dark yellow, near-   ly orange, melancholy, as heavy as honey, and it made me   thirsty. That doesn’t say it all, nor even a greater part. Yet it   seems even more incomplete when we were there in person.   Half the day in half the room. The wool makes one itch and   the scratching makes one warm. But herself that she obeyed   she dressed. It talks. The baby is scrubbed everywhere, he is   an apple. They are true kitchen stalwarts. The smell of   breathing fish and breathing shells seems sad, a mystery, rap-   turous, then dead. A self-centered being, in this different   world. A urinating doll, half-buried in sand. She is lying on   her stomach with one eye closed, driving a toy truck along   the road she has cleared with her fingers. I mean untroubled   by the distortions. That was the fashion when she was a   young woman and famed for her beauty, surrounded by   beaux. Once it was circular and that shape can still be seen   from the air. Protected by the dog. Protected by foghorns,   frog honks, cricket circles on the brown hills. It was a   message of happiness by which we were called into the room,   as if to receive a birthday present given early, because it was   too large to hide, or alive, a pony perhaps, his mane trimmed   with colored ribbons.",fear
"Everyone knows about the calm that happens before the storm. In ""Seeking A Friend for the End of the World"", what's amazing is just how long that calm lasts.Throughout the first part of this film, you can't help but wonder, as you watch, how you would react if you heard nonchalant reports on radio and TV about a 70-mile wide asteroid heading for Earth and destroying life as we know it. Would you seek refuge in a fallout shelter and hope for the best, or say ""To hell with it!"" and do all the things you couldn't do when there was established order with a purpose?Dodge (Steve Carell) seems to find a third option no one else even tries to consider: sitting calmly and maintaining his own order as virtually everyone else is participating in an orgy or a riot. While being calm works for him as a survival instinct, it also reflects his loneliness. The more people surrounding him, the lonelier he seems.Very similar to Bill Murray's character in ""Lost In Translation"", Carell is great at conveying so much despite doing so little. It becomes all the more fascinating when he's the only character in the movie who does not throw caution into the wind. After all, would you be this calm if the world was going to end?Keira Knightley is Penny, a vibrant but distraught British woman who lives in the same building as Dodge. She appears one night outside his window, and is frantically crying after her realization that she can't fly back home to Great Britain to see her family. Knightley serves as a great contrast to Carell in many ways, and she is a welcome presence in this movie. And I am SO glad the film didn't try to cover her sweet British accent.The film evolves into a sort of road-trip movie when a riot ensues outside their apartment building, and Dodge persuades Penny to drive to Somerset, Delaware because he knows someone who owns an airplane. As it turns out, Dodge also had a high school girlfriend who wrote to him a few months earlier, before his wife left him.Sounds like a familiar journey from another movie? Well, ""Seeking A Friend For The End of the World"" takes you in one direction you think you're going, and then often makes a sharp left when you least expect it. The movie is also funnier than the title suggests, has some startling moments I never saw coming nor expected, and keeps you watching for many reasons.Is there a love story between Dodge and Penny? Like the recent ""Salmon Fishing In The Yemen"" (2012), you find yourself unsure if the two main characters should fall in love, or if there is at least a little attraction, or if it really makes any difference.There are other things you wonder while watching this movie. Most notably, is the world really going to end? Everyone in this movie seems to think so. While it's fascinating to see how different characters react to the news, you keep watching because you want to see if it really does. It can't be a dream or a delusion, can it?It's great that in a summer season of action flicks and disaster films, there's one film that takes its time showing how ordinary people react to extraordinary things. There's an asteroid headed towards Earth, but there are no explosions, deaths, astronauts, superheroes, or even (surprisingly) camera shots of the sky in this movie whatsoever. Moviegoers who hated ""Armageddon"" (1998) will be relieved, I'm sure.Besides Carell and Knightley, other fairly well-known actors show up so briefly, their appearances could practically be considered cameos. Still, every performance by everyone involved stays with you to the point where you probably pinpoint one character and say, ""Yeah, I'd probably be THAT guy given the circumstances"". As the doomsday clock counts down and the movie ends, you may find yourself reevaluating what you want the last image in your mind to be before it's all over.",fear

Heavy tells a storyabout a furnace foreman who always yelledat the laborers for failing to cleanthe bag house of the built-up filthfrom hours of cooking scrap iron and ore.The men told him it was too dangerousto walk on the tin-roofed panels;their weight could causethem to fall some 30 feetinto the gaping mouth of a flaming furnace below.“Nonsense,” the foreman yelled,“you’re all just lazy Polacks.”(he called everyone Polacks).The foreman then proceeded to walkacross the roof as the men stood nearby,with mouths open, near the safety of side beams.“You see,” he said standing in the middleas hydraulics moved shuttersup and down to capture the sulphur dust. Then the foreman moved forwardand before anyone could shout,he crashed through the roof,screaming into a reddened pot of molten metal;the oxygen in his body making popping soundsas it entered.

"came in an envelope with no return address;she was small, wore wrinkled dress of figuredcotton, full from neck to ankles, with a buttonof bone at the throat, a collar of torn lace.She was standing before a monumental house—on the scale you see in certain English films:urns, curved drives, stone lions, and an entrance fartoo vast for any home. She was not of that place,for she had a foreign look, and tangled black hair,and an ikon, heavy and strange, dangling froman oversize chain around her neck, that lookedas if some tall adult had taken it from his,and hung it there as a charm to keep her safefrom a world of infinite harm that soonwould take him far from her, and leave herstanding, as she stood now—barefoot, gazingwithout expression into distance, awayfrom the grandeur of that house, its gravelwalks and sculpted gardens. She carried a basketfull of flames, but whether fire or flowerswith crimson petals shading toward a central gold,was hard to say—though certainly, it burned,and the light within it had nowhere elseto go, and so fed on itself, intensified its redand burning glow, the only color in the scene.The rest was done in grays, light and shadowas they played along her dress, across her face,and through her midnight hair, lively with bees.At first they seemed just errant bits of shade,until the humming grew too loud to be deniedas the bees flew in and out, as if choreographedin a country dance between the fields of sunand the black tangle of her hair.                                                   Without warninga window on one of the upper floors flew open—wind had caught the casement, a silken lengthof curtain filled like a billowing sail—the beesbegan to stream out from her hair, straightto the single opening in the high facade. Inside,a moment later—the sound of screams.The girl—who had through all of this seemedunconcerned and blank—all at once looked up.She shook her head, her mane of hair freedof its burden of bees, and walked away,out of the picture frame, far beyondthe confines of the envelope that brought herimage here—here, where the days grow longernow, the air begins to warm, dread grows tofear among us, and the bees swarm.",fear

Her pink-and-silver t-shirt read PRINCESS. I shut my car door, and a grousestartled off the fence, veered away over bent switchgrass. The girl—Allie—said her little sisters made the jewelry, in the gray houseat the base of the hill; maybe her price included the pictures Iwalked behind her to take: the marker for 1890, then the more recentgraves, in ground seared and hardpanned by wind and snow anddesolation; tied, bandana-pouches of tobacco, and ribbons, like fistsand fingers shifting and fluttering; a few tough bright flowers left;gray-blue sky rolling above to the edges of horizon all around,spitting, cooking up a storm. I stood and turned back towardthe arch again, where Allie and her friend, if he was a friend, hadn’tspoken a word to one another. For the first time in my lifeI wished I’d had some cigarettes— to smoke with them, at least offer,something to do with strangers you might sit a while beside till maybeone of you thought of something to say.

"I'm not really sure what I just watched but this was a far cry from the previous two movies. The worst offense that this movie has to atone for is the fact that it wasn't scary. Not even in the slightest sense. Keep in mind that this was supposed to be a Horror movie.Right from the get-go it was pretty much clear ""who would make it out of the movie alive"" [""The Chosen One""-trope]. And that's why the whole movie flopped. There was no real danger. The entire movie felt like a ""documentary"" about the origin story. Also, Samara was barely in the movie, which for the record was the main reason for my disgruntlement.Final verdict: This movie is more of a filler. It's main purpose is to connect the links from the past to what is yet to come. This may sound wrong but the end of the movie was actually the best part (and it wasn't because the movie ended. It's because we were left with an intriguing cliffhanger. I like that). I remain hopeful for the upcoming movie in the franchise.",fear

"As a big fan of the book, I found the movie interpretation of The Host fantastic, a must see for sci-fi fans. However, I do recommend reading the book first, as otherwise the complicated plot line could confuse. The Host is a totally different genre from twilight, and should appeal to a totally different audience, with the main theme being an alien invasion from the point of view of the alien, with a little bit of romance on the side. The movie sticks mostly to the plot outline of the book; a few minor details are not mentioned but no major plot changes occur, overall I think The Host is a wonderful example of how brilliant movies always come from brilliant books, and I hope to see a few more sci-fi novels, and perhaps movies from Stephanie Meyer in the future.

Some facts about Knight and Day: Estimated Budget: $117 Mn Estimated Gross Collections: $76.5 Mn It was a commercial entertainer with popular stars like Tom and Cameron which was supposed to make huge money but instead turned out to be a loss making venture. So when its production house Fox Studios decided to produce its Bollywood remake at a whopping cost of 140 Cr (~$22 Mn) you might question their business sense. But considering the recent big bollywood hits like Kick, Dhoom 3, Krrish 3 it was a good decision timed with a 5 days long festive weekend.Movie has all the right ingredients to set the cash registers ringing; Good looking lead pair, Fancy Locales, Breathtaking stunts (3-4), Peppy music but still the director has been able to turn this into a boring and yawning experience. Mind you this requires some talent.Film has a similar plot to the original one where Rajveer Nanda (Hrithik Roshan) is a stylish and immensely talented thief who has stolen Kohinoor diamond from London based on an open public challenge, to all concerned thieves, by an International terrorist Omar (Danny Denzongpa). For some reason (revealed in climax) Rajveer decides to not handover the diamond to Omar and this triggers a chase to get Kohinoor. Entire story revolves around this chase and ends with a long, tacky and glaringly clichéd climax.Katrina is weaved into the plot as she encounters Rajveer by accident in a café where she is waiting for her blind date from some Dating website. She does what she has been doing for the last 7-8 yrs i.e. to look dumb (quite natural in that), look beautiful and dance well. It will be a crime to expect anything more out of her as she chooses her movies based on her areas of strength.Other supporting actors don't have much to do as majority screen space is reserved for the lead pair. Still its refreshing to see actors like Kanwaljeet Singh and Deepti Nawal on screen after a long time.Films dialogs and climax will take you back to the 80s action cinema. Climax is the same 'we will take the heroine, get the diamond to save her' kind of which we have experience with Pran and Ranjeet. Only difference is that Kali Pahadi has been replaced by Picturesque Prague.Based on the trailer and hype surrounding the film, you might want to believe that it can be a decent watch but the long running time of 2 hrs 35 min makes you cry Stop the pain.It has to be seen how much profitable it turns out for the makers but with such a massive budget even a 200 Cr collection will not result in good profits.For the viewers only one thing.

"The buzz saw snarled and rattled in the yardAnd made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of wood,Sweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it.And from there those that lifted eyes could countFive mountain ranges one behind the otherUnder the sunset far into Vermont.And the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled,As it ran light, or had to bear a load.And nothing happened: day was all but done.Call it a day, I wish they might have saidTo please the boy by giving him the half hourThat a boy counts so much when saved from work.His sister stood beside him in her apronTo tell them ‘Supper.’ At the word, the saw,As if to prove saws knew what supper meant,Leaped out at the boy’s hand, or seemed to leap—He must have given the hand. However it was, Neither refused the meeting. But the hand!The boy’s first outcry was a rueful laugh,As he swung toward them holding up the handHalf in appeal, but half as if to keepThe life from spilling. Then the boy saw all—Since he was old enough to know, big boyDoing a man’s work, though a child at heart— He saw all spoiled. ‘Don’t let him cut my hand off—The doctor, when he comes. Don’t let him, sister!’So. But the hand was gone already.The doctor put him in the dark of ether.He lay and puffed his lips out with his breath.And then—the watcher at his pulse took fright.No one believed.

"Growing up, I barely knew the Bible, but readand reread the part when Cain drifted eastor was drawn that way, into a place of desolation, the land of Nod, there to begin, with a wife of unknown origin, another race of men,under the mark of God. As a boy, I thought Nod would be a place where the blue scillas would bloom gray, a country of the rack and screw, the serrated sword, where the very serving cups were bone. As a grown man, I’ve heard that Nod never was a nation—of Cain’s offspring, or anyone—but a mistranslation of “wander,” so Cain could go wherever, and be in Nod. Far more than in God, I believe in Cain, who destroyed his own brother, and therefore in any citycould have his wish, and be alone.",fear

"Aside from freer language and more explicitly sexual humour, When Harry met Sally is a very traditional romantic comedy, very much in the mould established in 1934 by It Happened One Night. Two very different but evenly-matched people are thrown together by circumstance. They are initially hostile to one another, but over the course of the film, this hostility turns to love as their personalities are softened by exposure to their opposites. Indeed, the central traits of Harry and Sally correspond very directly to those of Peter and Ellen in IHON - he worldly-wise and cynical, she spoiled and certain of what's what. Neither of them, it turns out, is as right or as self-confidant as they believe. What's very modern about WHMS is its attitude to long-term relationships. It's no longer enough for the couple simply to fall in love and live happily ever after. They must have a full and real understanding of exactly what, or who, they're letting themselves in for. They must also be sexually compatible (hence the importance of their having slept with one another before they finally get together). Within this framework of traditional romance in an unromantic world, WHMS is almost perfect. Structurally, there are no gaps or implausibilities. Even the central coincidence of these people running into each other under these circumstances is answered. The short but affecting intermissions of successful old couples describing their relationships are not only crucial to the pacing of the film, they also make the point that Harry and Sally are just another couple with an unusual and interesting story. There's an element of luck and coincidence in every successful relationship. The effectiveness of the film's structure is perhaps best highlighted by the soundtrack. There's a perfectly selected Louis Armstrong track for every phase of their relationship - the soundtrack not only complements the mood of the film, it comments on the action. The acting is superb, with the two main protagonists as well as their two foils (Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher) all giving career-best comic performances. Without such fantastic performances, it's very possible that the film could have failed: these are essentially self-indulgent people, that we sympathise with them and recognise them is in great measure down to the stars. Finally, the script is fantastic. Of course nobody really speaks like that, but like all great scripts it distills emotions and points of view into a few lines. And it's funny. The one-liners are still sharp and amusing on the twentieth viewing, and the set-pieces are beautifully realised (the orgasm scene is only the most famous - check out Harry's olympic sex-dream speech - ""Must have been the dismount"" - or the ""I'm through making a schmuck out of myself"" phone call). All this, and a dinner party talking point about male and female relationships. Can we ever be just friends? Not even with an ugly girl? ""Nah, you pretty much want to nail them too.""",fear

"There are enough things inherent in ""Coin Heist"" that it really shouldn't work. The plot is outlandish, the ending descends into schmaltz, and (at heart) it's a teen coming-of-age drama (not like there are any of those floating around these days). However, despite all the unevenness and clichés, ""Coin Heist"" still manages to at least be entertaining due to the great acting and slickness of the setup.For a basic plot summary (no spoilers), ""Coin Heist"" sees Jason (Alex Saxon) struggling with the reality that his father has been stealing from his high school's endowment, leaving the father in prison and the school in danger of shutting down. After a field trip to the U.S. mint, however, Jason's friend Alice (Alexis G. Zall), a hacker at heart and in skill, devises a plan to infiltrate the mint and print some rare coins that can be sold to save the school. The plan will only work, however, if they can also rope in organization queen Dakota (Sasha Pieterse) and outsider Benny (Jay Walker).For the first half or so of ""Coin Heist"", I was invested in the characters and their mission. The producers do a great job of setting up the backgrounds of each character, and I really felt like they could be real high-schoolers. Sure, their mission is highly improbable, but that's what cinema is all about, right?!The problem, however, is that after that roughly half-way point my investment really started to wane for two reasons:1. The build-up to the caper was much more interesting than the caper itself; and 2. I felt that the ending descending into a bit too much hijinx and corniness for my liking. I realize this is a film directed at teens, so perhaps it plays a bit better to that demographic, but for an older viewer it seemed like a bit of a letdown to build up these great characters and then have them, in most cases, succumb to the tropes of the genre I was afraid would happen from the get-go.So, while I can easily give ""Coin Heist"" a slightly-better-than-average 6 out of 10 stars here, I feel that it failed to take that ""next step"" into the greatness range due to its ""running out of steam"" in the latter portion. The target audience (teens) may disagree with me here, of course.",fear

"XOXO tells stories about six different people that revolved around an electronic dance music festival. A young DJ, a manager, a hopeless romantic girl, an apathetic man, and a struggling couple. Their paths will collide and somehow, the music festival will brought out their worst and their best.Plot-wise, this movie is really generic. None of the twists and resolutions are shocking nor original. The same can be say for the characters, as they were taken out of boring overdone tropes that previous movies has. The actors did an okay job, with Brett DelBuono rises among the rest. Sarah Hyland could be much better, given her Modern Family roots.The visuals in this movie however, are appealing and engaging. Although there are no jaw dropping shots, this movie managed to capture the festival's spirit (which basically just a lot of people taking drugs and jump around til they're tired) just right.If you like EDM and are looking for visual references, go ahead and watch. Otherwise, save your time. You're really not missing anything.",fear

"I loved this movie!! It did differ from the book in certain little ways but not enough that it would make this a bad movie by any means, if they would have added every detail the movie would have been four hours long. The actors were great in it, the scenes were very well done, and the mystery was enough to keep your attention even if you read the book. I was very happy when they kept to a huge portion of the storyline, and esp the ending, that were in the book. If you are a fan of Spark's other books or movies you will def love this one, but even if you aren't there is enough in this movie to keep your attention.

"Only reason I started to watch was due to the Hotel De l'Europe being included in the film. Unfortunately they didn't manage to capture anything about the beauty and uniqueness of this historical place. The characters seemed without real substance, impossible to understand the inclusion of the porn shops, death of a heavy metal type, picking on homeless people, etc. Film was trying at times to be a comedy and then dealing with serious issues. It did not manage to reveal the feeling of Amsterdam and I am curious why it was made in the first place. William Hurt's southern accent was somewhat interesting, although the minimal concern about his daughter's disappearance was bizarre. Amsterdam detectives are displayed as complete idiots. Yes, this film is quite a dud.",fear

"I just began to watch the movie (though I do not watch Hindi movies a lot) but in the beginning, the timeline of 1971 war between Bangladesh and Pakistan (Which was later changed as Indo-Pak war 1971) was full of lie and manipulation. Bangladesh was never born from the war between India and Pakistan, 1971. It was a long history and clash between Bangladesh and Pakistan since 1952 Language revolution. Later India joined the war (3 December, 1971) and helped the Freedom Fighters' of Bangladesh. As a Bangladeshi, I am not denying the fact that India helped us a lot that time, but its my right to protest against the proper manipulation of a country's birth history! It was our great leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who declared the independence of Bangladesh in 26 March, 1971 and after that the war began between East and West Pakistan. East Pakistan later became Bangladesh, a sovereign state. Along with 90000 soldiers Pakistan army surrendered to the commander in chief of India and Bangladesh joint forces. The instrument letter of surrender clears the fact. Anyone can search in internet and even in wikipedia for the truth : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War",fear

"Dark City was one of the more ambiguous movies I have seen in a long time. It could be best described as a mystery/sci-fi fantasy movie where the characters are placed out of time and out of place.  The movie definitely had style.  From which era, I am not sure.  It was a mixture of America in the 1920's (by the style of dress, cars), and 30's and 40's and 50's...  I thought that the intentional mixture of culture throughout the different eras really contributed to the mystic (and confusion) of the movie. However, the plot I cannot really comment on.  I can see where some members of the audience would feel frustrated in watching such a movie.  Nothing really made much sense the first time around.  It was, well, strange to say the least.  But watching the movie gave me a feeling of despair, fear and oppression.  The dark, wet and dirty streets of the city really created an atmosphere of loathing and suffocation.  I thought Jennifer Connelly was brilliant and gorgeous.  Overall, it was an enjoyable movie.",anger

"When I sleep I see a child  hidden between the legs of a scarred man, their sunburnt backs breathe cold air, the child faces me and the pier’s roof swallows the mooncut by the clouds behind them.

"You wouldn't have believed it, how the man, a little touched perhaps,  set his hands together and prayed for happiness, yet not his own; he meant his people, by which he meant not people really, but trees and cows, the dirty horses, dogs, the fox who lived at the back of his place with her kits, and the very night who settled down to rock his place to sleep, the place he tried so hard to tend he found he mended fences in his sleep. He said to the you above, who, let's be honest, doesn't say too much, I need you now up there to give my people happiness, you let them smile and know the reason; hear my prayer, Old Yam. The you who's you might laugh at that, and I agree, it's funny to make a prayer like that, the down-home words and yonder reach of what he said; and calling God the Elder Sweet Potato, shucks, that's pretty funny, and kind of sad.",anger

"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie after all the press and favourable ratings. We saw it on opening day in the Detroit area and found the movie to be just OK. I give it a 4 on the scale of 10. Acting was OK, script was so so. I was expecting much more action I guess. The movie was at least 45 minutes too long IMO, most of the people walking out of the large theatre which was about 3/4 empty felt about the same way based on comments that we overheard. The story seemed to ramble on with no progression, little dramatic tension and then ended at what seemed to be an arbitrary point. It seemed that there wasn't a lot of continuity from scene to scene. In short, given the positive press, it was a disappointment.",anger
"I would have liked to write about the story, but there wasn't any. I would have liked to quote a couple of hard hitting dialogs from the movie but ""hinglish"" is only funny for like 5 minutes, after that its overkill. I would have liked to swoon over the 'keep-u-guessing suspense' but it was as predictable as... um mm, a Yash raj movie (?). I would have liked to talk of the edge-of-the-seat action, but I don't like cartoons much. *sigh*All in all, this movie is perfect for: 1. people attempting suicide - I promise it'll push you over the edge 2. Sado-masochists- this movie is way more effective than the barbed wire that Silas guy in the Da-Vinci code wore. 3. People researching alternative ways to spread terrorism - I swear the audience leaving the hall seemed to be in a mood to kill someone 4. Movie Piraters: More power to them. If any movies deserves to not have the audience spending money to watch - this is it. 5.Barnacles, most types of plankton & green algae - Because almost all other living things would require an IQ factor somewhat greater than what the movie offers. Afterthought: The director of the movie, obviously, is a species of his own. ( And i hope to god that he is the only one of his kind..one is enough)Things that could have made this a better movie: 1. A story 2. A choreographer 3. A Screenplay writer 4. A stunt coordinator 5. A story (Did I already say that?) 6. A director - preferably one who is not mentally challenged (although even one who was challenged could have done a better job) 7. Anil Kapoor=Bubonic plague - Avoid at all costs 8. A statutory warning - ""Watching Yash Raj movies is Injurious to your mental health"" ?Things I liked about the movie: 1. Kareena Kapoor - For obvious reasons 2. The English sub-titles - ""Mera Dil Kho Gaya"" becomes - ""My heart is in a void"" , ""Chaliya Chaliya Chaliya"" turns into ""Im a flirt, Im a lover, Im a vagabond"" ..priceless.In short, Tashan to me, is like the opposite of a Rubrics cube - The cube is supposed to increase the IQ of the player, Tashan promises to lower your IQ, and that.. in a mere 2.5 hours! Woot!*sigh*..But thats just me. I could be wrong You've been warned anyways.",anger
"The only thing I liked on this movie was the location. It was shot in Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. Main scenes took place in the National Theater ""Ivan Vasov"", but also in some of the Bulgarien Mountains. The story, however, was disgusting. The uniforms of the soldier were obviously purchased on one of the flee-markets in Sofia, where all sorts of old and not so old military ""Haute-Coulture"" is sold (lot of Nazi-junk and all kinds of Warshaw-Pact stuff). It was obvious that the only thing that was brought from Hollywood to the location were the four or six main-actors. Everything else, starting from the candles over the guns, the cars and ending with jewelery of the princess came from Bulgarien stocks. It's amazing that for a movie that claims to play in the post-nuclear US not the slightest effort is made to camouflage the original location of the plot.",anger

"To begin with, if a person is eager enough to either appreciate or criticize HERO just because its produced & presented by Salman Khan then that would be a faulty way of watching or rating the film unarguably. So let us keep 'The Salman factor' associated with the project aside and consider this as an important debut venture of a young 'industry' couple willing to win over the audience through their honest efforts.But moving ahead, the second hurdle HERO is bound to face inevitably is the comparison with its original musical gem HERO (released in 1983), that is still fresh in the minds as well as in the precious collection of Hindi film music lovers all over the world. The present version of HERO largely follows Ghai's classic in the first half and therefore cannot avoid the comparisons drawn by the viewers, being an official remake coming after 32 long years.However, respecting the makers as well as the debutants relying a lot on the film, I would like to keep the comparison for the later part of the review and begin with the film as a fresh release presented with a major publicity campaign. So as a love story with the catchy title HERO, introducing two youngsters from the families belonging to the industry itself, what can be the first thing expected from the film by the excited viewers?The very first thing has to be some kind of novelty in the project in terms of storyline, execution, sequences, action, conflicts, the loving chemistry and the soundtrack making it a worth watching experience for all. But sadly Nikhil Advani's HERO has got nothing to offer in these crucial departments and the film simply remains a lazily or rather unintelligently made project relying too heavily on the person promoting it from the front having a gigantic fan following. In fact watching the film progressing so boringly on a badly written script with nothing engrossing at all happening in those two hours, one is forced to assume that maybe it's the case of too many cooks spoiling the dish as the saying goes. Probably too much interference coming from all corners (Shettys, Pancholis & Khans) turned the film into an unentertaining mess that was supposed to be a remake of a highly enjoyable and hit movie of the 80s. Commencing on a very poor note following the typical Bollywood format and a below average party song, HERO fails to make any kind of impact within its first 20 minutes itself and then everything happening so quickly defying all the logics simply puts the viewer off before the intermission only. Post interval it even stops following the original and goes on with its own clichéd and mediocre plot with no sense of time-gaps or logical justifications as such.To say the least, there is no depth found in either the two persons loving or the others opposing their love right till the climax. As a result, you never feel like watching an intense love story with a lot of conflict involved. The film begins and keeps delivering the same seen before sequences one after another without caring about the people sitting in the theater having spent their hard earned money and time. In other words, HERO of 2015 can easily be presented as a perfect example of most irresponsible film made in the present times playing with two young careers.Also its a film having the most inappropriate people chosen as the cast, who fail to establish any kind of connect with the given roles be it a father, an uncle, a bhabhi, a mother or the villains. So where Tigmanshu Dhulia falters big time in playing the father (despite being a gifted performer), the rest of the actors simply play their roles as another usual assignment signed to earn some quick bucks. And as it is said, nothing can hamper a film more badly than a wrong casting.A fine cinematography and action accompanied by some mediocre writing, sloppy editing and dull dialogues keep affecting the film at various points. Like its really amusing to notice an inspector suddenly giving the instructions from a helicopter, who was just doing the same at the ground in exactly the previous shot. Moreover a scene showing the girl praying to BUDDHA considering him as a GOD, clearly reveals how much less the writers as well as the youngsters know about the enlightened soul and his views about the existence of God.A big letdown in the music department too, the only likable track remains the Salman Khan number that has been arranged well with a catchy hook line working fine. But God knows when the music directors would understand that by only calling in Rahat Fateh Ali Khan to render a track doesn't ensure you a hit song always.Coming to the two debutantes, Sooraj certainly has got a decent screen presence with a solid physique to display, particularly in the actions sequences and Athiya Shetty looks pretty in some specific scenes only to put it honestly. However as far as the performances are concerned, they both got to thank their 'surnames' much more than the inherited talent, that needs to be accepted as a harsh truth at this particular point of time (as nobody knows what fate or luck has in store for them in the coming years).In few words, Nikhil Advani's film quite brutally and shamelessly murders Ghai's HERO, particularly while adapting its fabulously written characterizations. And thus cannot be recommended for anything at all.",anger

"Low expectations are seldom met for films that go straight to video. This is an exception for me.Kilmer (McPhearson) plays a troubled marine who is sought out by a war buddy and travels to Arizona to reunite. When McPhearson arrives, he realizes that the town and its people are acting very strange. He meets Rhodes (Cole), who basically runs the town, and gets less than welcomed. The suspense thickens as the movie goes, adding a clever character twist at the end.Kilmer does a good job with the role, but maybe I'm bias because I've liked his movies for a while. His delivery is solid, from interaction with Esposito to rugged one-liners with the bad guys. I even didn't mind him looking a little bloated, because he was playing the washed up war vet.The only trouble I had was the way he tried to sell the excessively used close up blank stare, meant to show McPhearson suffering from his past. It simply came off bored.The pacing is spot on. You dive right in with a shocking opening scene and build up accordingly into the meat of the story. It is pleasantly predictable at the right times, yet your left guessing when you want to be.The ending is where this one will lose some. It starts to do what that string of films that destroyed Steven Segal's career did. Movies often step out of themselves at the end and beat you over the head with a message. This one gets a little self righteous, but not to where I thought it brought things down.It's not Rambo or Die Hard, but if you're in the mood for a rental with solid action and suspense, its worth the four or five bucks.",anger

"Richard (Tim Daly) is a descendant of the original Dr. Jekyll. Although he works in a perfume laboratory, he has bigger dreams. Rick lives with a delightful fiancé (Lysette Anthony) but no wedding date has been set. One day, Richard inherits his relatives books and notes, only to stumble upon the secret formula used to create the infamous Mr. Hyde. He mixes up a batch and drinks it. However, Richard is in trouble when his alias turns out to be a conniving woman (Sean Young). Is there a way out of this mess? Fans of romantic comedies will likely be happy to add this to their list of viewing pleasures. Daly, Young, and Anthony are all very attractive performers, with charm oozing everywhere. The rest of the cast is delightful, too, with Jeremy Piven doing his usual good turn. The plot may be silly but it is fun, too. As for the interior of Richard's apartment, it is to die for; one may want to put the VCR on pause to recreate the look. In short, if you like fast, fun films with some kisses thrown in now and again, this one is for you.",anger

This looks like it was intended for an audience of grade six kids-who will forgive anything if they get to see a film-any film. Anyone other than a twelve year old probably won't like this movie much since it is basically a dull ride with predictable events happening one after the other. It seems that they are making films like this in batches-three movies in short succession about space bases just like three movies in succession about future civilizations divided into sects aka Divergent-The Giver & The Hunger Games. Stranded is a lot like The Last Days on Mars and Europa Report. Christian Slater has vanished from movies lately so here is a chance to see him do his stuff. His acting is fine but the script isn't very interesting. If you just have to see everything they do in the science fiction style see this-otherwise-like Frank Zappa said-'save your money and don't go to the show'-sometimes it just ain't worth gong to.,anger

"By the last few times we saw her it was clear That things were different. When you tried to help her  Get out of the car or get from the car to the door Or across the apartment house hall to the elevator  There was a new sense of heaviness  Or of inertia in the body. It wasn’t  That she was less willing to be helped to walk But that the walking itself had become less willing.  Maybe the stupid demogorgon blind  Recalcitrance of body, resentful of the laws  Of mind and spirit, was getting its own back now, Or maybe a new and subtle, alien,  Intelligence of body was obedient now  To other laws: “Weight is the measure of The force with which a body is drawn downward To the center of the earth”; “Inertia is  The tendency of a body to resist  Proceeding to its fate in any way  Other than that determined for itself.” That evening, at the Bromells’ apartment, after She had been carried up through the rational structure  By articulate stages, floor after flashing floor, And after we helped her get across the hall, And get across the room to a chair, somehow  We got her seated in a chair that was placed  A little too far away from the nearest table,  At the edge of the abyss, and there she sat, Exposed, her body the object of our attention— The heaviness of it, the helpless graceless leg, The thick stocking, the leg brace, the medical shoe. At work between herself and us there was  A new principle of social awkwardness  And skillfulness required of each of us.  Our tones of voice in this easy conversation  Were instruments of marvelous finesse,  Measuring and maintaining with exactitude  “The fact or condition of the difference There was between us, both in space and time.” Her smiling made her look as if she had Just then tasted something delicious, the charm  Her courtesy attributed to her friends. This decent elegant fellow human being Was seated in virtue, character, disability,  Behind her the order of the ranged bookshelves,  The windows monitored by Venetian blinds— “These can be raised or lowered; numerous slats,  Horizontally arranged, and parallel, Which can be tilted so as to admit Precisely the desired light or air.” We were all her friends, Maggie, and Bill, and Anne,  And I, and the nice Boston Brahmin elderly man  Named Duncan, utterly friendly and benign. And of course it wasn’t whether or not the world  Was benign but whether it looked at her too much.  She wasn’t “painfully shy” but just the same  I wouldn’t be surprised if there had been  Painfulness in her shyness earlier on, Say at dancing school. Like others, though, she had  Survived her childhood somehow. Nor do I mean  She was unhappy. Maybe more or less so  Before her marriage. One had the sense of trips  Arranged, committees, concerts, baffled courage  Living it through, giving it order and style.  And one had the sense of the late marriage as of  Two bafflements inventing the sense they made  Together. The marriage seemed, to the outside world,  And probably was, radiant and triumphant,  And I think that one could almost certainly say  That during the last, heroic, phase of things,  After his death, and after the stroke, she had  By force of character and careful management,  Maintained a certain degree of happiness. The books there on the bookshelves told their stories, Line after line, all of them evenly spaced, And spaces between the words. You could fall through the spaces.  In one of the books Dr. Johnson told the story:  “In the scale of being, wherever it begins,  Or ends, there are chasms infinitely deep;  Infinite vacuities ... For surely, Nothing can so disturb the passions, or  Perplex the intellects of man so much,  As the disruption of this union with  Visible nature, separation from all That has delighted or engaged him, a change Not only of the place but of the manner  Of his being, an entrance into a state Not simply which he knows not, but perhaps  A state he has not faculties to know.” The dinner was delicious, fresh greens, and reds,  And yellows, produce of the season due, And fish from the nearby sea; and there were also  Ashes to be eaten, and dirt to drink.",anger

As a Turk I was told that Armenian Genocide was a lie. After some research I couldn't actually find any proof to suggest it as well and what we learned made more sense than the genocide. Anyway lie or not I don't think voting bad to prevent this movie to go big screen is just useless. Yes this may be just propaganda but history is never one sided so let people learnsomething from it. The best way to show evidence to millions is by movies and us blocking it just makes us look bad. I didn'tlike the movie but we should let it be seen otherwise it's just censoring for no reason.,anger

"Down to Earth is a sporadically funny movie starring Chris Rock.  I thought the idea was creative (even though it is basically a remake of Heaven Can Wait).  Rock is hilarious at times and so are some of the others. However, something is missing and I'm not sure what it is.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film and happen to be a big Chris Rock fan.  It just needed a little more. You can probably wait until video to see it.",anger

"Two genres that seem the hardest to get right are that of horror and sci-fi, but when you mix the two it makes for an even harder task. There have been a few that pulled it off like Alien, but more often than not they are a bust. The latest taking its chance is Stranded with Christian Slater leading the charge. Could this film have the monster horror, suspense and effects needed to pull this off or will it feel like you have actually been stranded? Stranded follows a lunar base that is hit by a meteor shower that does more than damage the base, it has brought along an unexpected alien spores. When one of the crew is infected the rest of the crew believe she is just delusional, but things quickly when it is unleashed and turns their already dire situation deadly. At first this film felt more like a SyFy original movie with some cheesy effects and performances, but as it moved forward it began to change direction in a positive way. The story takes some darker turns that helps to set the darker tone and give it a bigger feel. Christian Slater who has the ability to be awesome phones it in for the most part, but as it gets to the darker tone his performance actually gets a lot better. The rest of the cast are hit and miss for the most part, but don't hurt the overall finished film. The effects are a bit cheesy during the initial meteor shower action, but when it shifts over to more of the ""monster"" movie it picks up and the effects work a lot better. While there is no actual monster as you may hope, it does still work decently. While the movie works for the most part, the ending will leave some a bit confused or let down, as it tried to do something clever as opposed to just letting it play out as it wanted to.There are some decent gore moments, but nothing that really could have pushed this movie to the next level. It had some great opportunities but for whatever reason couldn't execute, most likely due to budget. For a straight to video release it actually delivers pretty well and makes for a decent rental. Slater has had some decent TV shows recently that just haven't connected with audiences, but has been churning out the straight to video films and if this one was any indication he is making some decent choices.",anger

Antonio Banderas is teriffic as the new Zorro and there's funny moments between Hopkins and Banderas as teacher and student respectively. Catherine Zeta-Jones is very appealing in her role also. The only real complaint I have is that the bad guys never seem like a real threat. The direction by Martin Campbell is very good and the editing was great. A very good movie.",anger

"Let us go hence, my songs; she will not hear. Let us go hence together without fear; Keep silence now, for singing-time is over, And over all old things and all things dear. She loves not you nor me as all we love her. Yea, though we sang as angels in her ear,          She would not hear. Let us rise up and part; she will not know. Let us go seaward as the great winds go, Full of blown sand and foam; what help is here? There is no help, for all these things are so, And all the world is bitter as a tear. And how these things are, though ye strove to show,          She would not know. Let us go home and hence; she will not weep. We gave love many dreams and days to keep, Flowers without scent, and fruits that would not grow, Saying 'If thou wilt, thrust in thy sickle and reap.' All is reaped now; no grass is left to mow; And we that sowed, though all we fell on sleep,          She would not weep. Let us go hence and rest; she will not love. She shall not hear us if we sing hereof, Nor see love's ways, how sore they are and steep. Come hence, let be, lie still; it is enough. love is a barren sea, bitter and deep; And though she saw all heaven in flower above,          She would not love. Let us give up, go down; she will not care. Though all the stars made gold of all the air, And the sea moving saw before it move One moon-flower making all the foam-flowers fair; Though all those waves went over us, and drove Deep down the stifling lips and drowning hair,          She would not care. Let us go hence, go hence; she will not see. Sing all once more together; surely she, She too, remembering days and words that were, Will turn a little toward us, sighing; but we, We are hence, we are gone, as though we had not been there. Nay, and though all men seeing had pity on me,          She would not see.",anger

"A lucky mistake shifts out-of-luck criminal Harry Lockhart (Robert Downey Jr) from the gritty streets to glossy showbiz in L.A, landing him a part in an upcoming film. Another mistake then shifts him from actor to private detective, and this is where Val Kilmer comes in and things start to go wrong, more wrong and unbelievably wrong until they've snowballed into an enjoyable detective mess -- all to impress failed actress Harmony (Next big thing: Michelle Monaghan).Shane Black's directorial debut 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' is a comic film noir. Even in the dazzling opening credits using a montage of contrasts of red, black and white, it is evident that this is no run-of-the-mill crime story, but a viciously entertaining ride from scene 01. What makes it so special is that it mixes equal doses of humour and crime like a $15,000,000 blender, pouring out a balanced end product and glazing it with a clever narrative coating by Robert Downey Jr. Black also sprinkles some rapid-fire dialogue onto his product, which is facilitated by the comedic chemistry between Downey and Kilmer. Some of the lines, gags and images are truly laugh-out-loud worthy. Everything else is nice, but forgettable.Its only problem, as far as I can see it, is its paper-thin plot. It does not seem believable; it is complex, dizzying and not nearly as involving as it would like to be. So back to formula on that one, and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang would be a near-perfect comedy-thriller.7.5/10",anger

"Yes the movie is heavily clichéd and the acting in some areas is more than weak as well as a less than impressive start but I can see an effort to be unique is on display here. The movie starts off like most generic slasher films with a cast of beautiful unknowns who just recently graduated from high school and throws a huge party, get drunk, have sex and after everyone leaves a handful of close friends decides to drive to a cemetery and play a silly game that's like ghosts in the graveyard. A mysterious girl then appears and wants to play with them and they let her, then things turn for the worst. To me from there on the movie gets way better with effective kills and a way more effective dragging a victim to their grave underground than in Drag Me To Hell, terror and suspense also come and maybe a too complicated plot and story for its own good but I give it kudos for trying to be ambitious. The acting too for some reason gets slightly better and far less annoying than it was in the beginning with Carly Schroeder from the indie film Mean Creek stealing the show. The film never gets truly terrifying and the zombie like ghosts though at some points creepy and scary were mostly not effective enough and seems too similar to the killer ghosts in Asian ghosts flicks of the past and they could of done better in that department but for a limited budget they weren't half bad either. The twisted shocker of an ending which they all had it coming was very effective to me and kept me from giving it a lower rating but I just wish it had a better first half and setup like it did in the middle and last half and because of that it was uneven and it also could of gone further with its interesting premise. Overall it's like Prom Night meets I Know What You Did Last Summer meets Tormented and at that was an entertaining watch if you have nothing better to do or watch. Rent it! 6 out of 10",anger

Six doilies                   of lace, six battleship cannon, six old beerbottles,                   six thick steaks, six love letters, six clocks                   running backwards, six watermelons, and six baby                   teeth, a six cornered hat on six men's heads, six                   lovers at once or one lover at sixes and sevens;                   how I confuse                   all this with my                   dream                   walking the tightrope bridge                   with gold knots                   over                   the mouth of an anemone/tissue spiral lips                   and holding on so that the ropes burned                   as if my wrists had been tiedIf George Washingtonhad notbeen the Fatherof my Countryit is doubtful that I would ever havefounda father.

There is romance between Rocky and his new girl friend who lives just as hard of a life as Rocky, and together they make life livable.

"I had a lot of expectations for this one. The visuals seemed stunning, the action heart-throbbing and the cast remarkable. And those thing were there but I just couldn't shake the feeling of this movie being nothing more than a paycheck.All the memorable dialog, scenes and concepts seemed all TOO familiar. The bullet cam was taken from the video game Max Payne, the keyboard to the face scene from an internet show called PurePwnage, the last line was also taken from a famous Bob Ross parody, the train cart scene was reminiscent of an old children's show based on a popular toy, and I could go on...I can look away and call them a coincidence but the last straw was the story. It was preposterously bad! Nothing made any sense, it seemed like they just pulled it out of a hat to house the action. All the characters the protagonist has to fight have no depth to them, this guy can do this, this guy can do that and in the end the hero has to fight the guys that can do this or that. Pathetic...As I exited the theater trying to keep my mind off the senseless favorable criticism that was going on behind me, I heard someone say ""If I was 13 and saw this movie, it would've been the best movie ever"". And that's what it is, a children's movie that tried to captivate the adult mind through pointless sex scenes and drama.",anger

"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Robert Luketic has never been able to recapture the charm of his Legally Blonde film, which in fact, was only charming due to Reece Witherspoon. Since then: Tad Hamilton, Monster in Law, 21 and now this wretched project. The battle of the sexes can be funny, but not in a tired cliché, slap you upside the head, hey let's throw in some raunchy stuff way.Katherine Heigl (Grey;s Anatomy) has somehow become the least desirable beautiful woman on planet earth. Could be that her characters are all the same - unlikeable! I thought she was really good in a little film called Side Effects, but since then has devolved into a 30 yr old wench.Gerard Butler somehow manages to maintain a bit of dignity in the film. A true man;s man in 300, he has proved to be mainstream enough in PS, I love You and now this one ... he just needs a better script, director and supporting cast.Speaking of supporting cast, aside from a couple of chuckles from the talented Cheryl Hines and John Michael Higgins, did anyone stop to think that an interesting side character or sub-plot might help? Or did they assume only simple minded women would even pay to see this? Either way, the only way it could have been worse is with a horrible soundtrack .... ummm ... yep, you got it ... pure garbage.

"-We'll Never Have Paris is a limited release film about a loser who, after dating a girl for 10 years, decides to finally propose. He then is almost unintentionally drawn into two different relationships, causing his girl to run away for Paris and hi to go after her and beg her forgiveness.-I saw it because Zachary Quinto was in it. Really that is the only reason. What I got was not a terrible movie, but it not that good.-The story would be cliché, cheesy, predictable, and over-the-top rom-com. However it is actually based on a true story, which is one of the best things the film has going for it.-The pace was not great, but I did not find it slow, just uneven.-The acting was a balance between good and bad. So yeah. It stars the guy who plays Howard Walawitz, and he did a fine job. The girl did a fine job. The daughter from taken did a fine job. And Zachary Quinto did a fine job. But nobody was more than just fine.-The characters are interesting to watch and entertainingly inconsistent, but most of the supporting characters don't seem to serve much of a purpose. Another problem with them is that you don't like any of them.-The music was interesting. Most of it was French, but they only spent the last 1/3rd of the film in France, so it did not seem to really fit that much.-So one of the worst things about the film is that it I a comedy, but I only laughed once in the entire film. It is also a 'romantic' movie, with only one romantic moment. So it really did not succeed at what it was trying to be.-Also, We'll Never Have Paris is rated-R and would have been the same or better if it were PG-13. It has some language in it, but not consistently harsh. It also has a strong PG-13 amount of sexual content.-So We'll Never Have Paris has a few small elements, like a good finale, that are entertaining, but it really did not succeed as a comedy or a romantic movie. Combine that with characters you don't really like and you get a film you have no attachment to. I'm going to say that We'll Never Have Paris really just isn't worth the time.",anger

"Read the comments for Karl Kozak's straight to DVD creature feature Clawed and you'll find that the general consensus is that the film is a serviceable piece of Sasquatch silliness with adequate performances, some so-so gore, an acceptable monster, and a reasonably creepy atmosphere.Sadly, it is this mediocrity that will almost certainly doom the film to obscurity. Were the movie a genuine steaming pile of yeti-dung, as the current rating of 3/10 strangely suggests, it would undoubtedly secure itself a cult following, as has happened with low budget big-foot trash-fest Night of the Demon (1980). As it stands, Clawed simply isn't memorable enough.The gazillionth movie to nick its basic premise from Jaws (a deadly creature threatens to ruin a small community's Spring Break tourist trade), Clawed plays everything just a little too safe, with all the expected clichés present and correct, but nowhere near enough originality on display.The one moment that stood out for me (apart from when one teen hottie wanders into the woods in just her bra and very short shorts) is the discovery of a mutilated grizzly bear impaled on a tree branch; if there had been more of this kind of grisly inventiveness, the whole thing would have made a lot more impact.",anger

"So I'm poking through the video store and see this DVD for Frankenstein. I flip it over and read the back and I'm literally rocking back on my heels, because the story is so damn similar to a series of Dean Koontz novels. I think Koontz is just above average most of the time, but lately his Frankenstein novels as well as 'Velocity' were just way above average; I really really liked them.Thing is, even though there's tons of similarities I don't see any credit for Koontz anywhere. So I wonder, if it's a coincidence, and rent the DVD and give it a watch.OK, I read and really liked the books (well, 1 & 2. The conclusion to the trilogy hasn't come out yet), and maybe that makes any view of the movie as being not as good unfair. But the movie falls horribly, wretchedly short of what Koontz's elaborate and intelligent storyline deserves. First off, this should have been a TV series that should have run for an entire season, so I guess you have to cut it some slack for trying to stuff a ton of story into only 90 minutes of movies. They should have said ""hey, let's give this thing the budget, talent, and directorial talent of 'Lost' or 'CSI'"" They didn't, and it shows.I can see why Koontz parted ways, even though they completely ripped off his story. The first scene of the book has an excellent grab-you-by-your-throat beginning where Deucalion - who is halfway around the world in Tibet - first learns Dr Frankenstein is still alive. He utters a roar of rage, fury, & despair and one of the monks asks him if someone is dead. ""Worse,"" he says. ""Someone is still alive."" Instead of that, we get a scene on a boat coming to America which makes Deucalion look something like a desperate beggar. Since we know Deucalion has mastered quantum physics and can shift instantly from one place to another in shadows, this doesn't make a lot of sense.The casting was off. The guy who played Deucalion could have served, but they needed some Lord of the Rings visual tricks to make him look bigger. There's a scene where he's standing next to the male detective - who's played by a short scrawny little guy - and you realize that the detective is *taller* than the monster.Both the detectives are horribly miscast. Parker Posy almost fits the physical description, but she can't act and seems more like a drug addict than anything else. The male detective looks nothing like the character in the books, who is tall, handsome, and wears loud hawaiian shirts.I've got no beef with the guy who played Dr Frankenstein, but I have serious problems with what they did with his lab. This is a genius billionaire who in the books had a huge private lab totally state of the art. Here it looks like a dirty abandoned insane asylum; the kind of thing you'd expect from the movie 'Seven'. I know the director was going for a dirty creepy feel, but it made absolutely no sense. Also Dr Frankenstein was a little more sympathetic than he should have done. In the books, this is a man who is perfectly willing to destroy the entire human race for the sake of perfection, and who takes sadistic delight in beating his wife - in fact designed her to be beaten and quickly heal. Instead we see a sort of conflicted Dr who seems one moment to care about his wife and the next is killing her. It makes no sense.I felt bad for the chick who played Dr Frankenstein's wife (s). She of course got no real character exposition, so of course none of her scenes made any sense.Totally excised from the story is anything that would help it make sense. We never really understand that 'children' Frankenstein is seeding the world with are psychotic killers who feel nothing but rage and torment and want to kill humans because they are jealous of the happiness normal humans seem able to feel. We aren't told that they are forbidden to kill anyone, even themselves, except at their master's direction, or that Frankenstein has a plan for slowly killing and replacing everyone in power. We barely see the autistic brother of the female detective, and the storyline of the autistic creation of Dr Frankenstein's - so fascinating in the books - who hates the autistic brother and is trying to escape his prison in the lab... this story is totally gone.No disembodied head & hand, which I thought was another interesting character from the books, and no sign of madness among Dr Frankenstein's household staff. Without these to interact with, and without the scenes of Dr Frankenstein beating her, there's no wonder that Frankenstein's wife has nothing much to do and no chance for character or storyline development.The storyline from the books is fascinating, and far far more believable than this, which does it a major injustice. It looks like they put 'some' money into it, but some of the effects remind me of 'Highlander', the series.If I had one wish for the story, it would be that it gets picked up by a major network who puts some real money into it and decides to do it right - slowly, not rushed - with lots of episodes to put in *all* of the story. That would be a hit TV series that could compete with anything, and would probably be scary as hell. This... isn't.",anger

"1 As I ebb’d with the ocean of life, As I wended the shores I know, As I walk’d where the ripples continually wash you Paumanok, Where they rustle up hoarse and sibilant, Where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways, I musing late in the autumn day, gazing off southward, Held by this electric self out of the pride of which I utter poems, Was seiz’d by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot, The rim, the sediment that stands for all the water and all the land of the globe. Fascinated, my eyes reverting from the south, dropt, to follow those slender windrows, Chaff, straw, splinters of wood, weeds, and the sea-gluten,   Scum, scales from shining rocks, leaves of salt-lettuce, left by the tide, Miles walking, the sound of breaking waves the other side of me, Paumanok there and then as I thought the old thought of likenesses, These you presented to me you fish-shaped island, As I wended the shores I know, As I walk’d with that electric self seeking types.                                              2 As I wend to the shores I know not, As I list to the dirge, the voices of men and women wreck’d, As I inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me, As the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer, I too but signify at the utmost a little wash’d-up drift, A few sands and dead leaves to gather, Gather, and merge myself as part of the sands and drift. O baffled, balk’d, bent to the very earth, Oppress’d with myself that I have dared to open my mouth, Aware now that amid all that blab whose echoes recoil upon me I have not once had the least idea who or what I am, But that before all my arrogant poems the real Me stands yet untouch’d, untold, altogether unreach’d, Withdrawn far, mocking me with mock-congratulatory signs and bows, With peals of distant ironical laughter at every word I have written, Pointing in silence to these songs, and then to the sand beneath. I perceive I have not really understood any thing, not a single object, and that no man ever can, Nature here in sight of the sea taking advantage of me to dart upon me and sting me, Because I have dared to open my mouth to sing at all.                                              3 You oceans both, I close with you, We murmur alike reproachfully rolling sands and drift, knowing not why, These little shreds indeed standing for you and me and all. You friable shore with trails of debris, You fish-shaped island, I take what is underfoot, What is yours is mine my father. I too Paumanok, I too have bubbled up, floated the measureless float, and been wash’d on your shores, I too am but a trail of drift and debris, I too leave little wrecks upon you, you fish-shaped island. I throw myself upon your breast my father, I cling to you so that you cannot unloose me, I hold you so firm till you answer me something. Kiss me my father, Touch me with your lips as I touch those I love, Breathe to me while I hold you close the secret of the murmuring I envy.                                              4 Ebb, ocean of life, (the flow will return,) Cease not your moaning you fierce old mother, Endlessly cry for your castaways, but fear not, deny not me, Rustle not up so hoarse and angry against my feet as I touch you or gather from you. I mean tenderly by you and all, I gather for myself and for this phantom looking down where we lead, and following me and mine. Me and mine, loose windrows, little corpses, Froth, snowy white, and bubbles, (See, from my dead lips the ooze exuding at last, See, the prismatic colors glistening and rolling,) Tufts of straw, sands, fragments, Buoy’d hither from many moods, one contradicting another, From the storm, the long calm, the darkness, the swell, Musing, pondering, a breath, a briny tear, a dab of liquid or soil, Up just as much out of fathomless workings fermented and thrown, A limp blossom or two, torn, just as much over waves floating, drifted at random, Just as much for us that sobbing dirge of Nature, Just as much whence we come that blare of the cloud-trumpets, We, capricious, brought hither we know not whence, spread out before you, You up there walking or sitting, Whoever you are, we too lie in drifts at your feet.",anger

"This is a perfect film if you just want to turn off your brain and have a good laugh. I was amazed at how low rated this film is--perhaps too many people take this film too seriously! This was never meant to be high art, but more like an extended live action version of a Wiley Coyote versus the Roadrunner cartoon. There was so much similarity, I half expected that this film would be sponsored by ACME.Kirk Douglas is the hapless bad guy bent on killing the more than amply endowed Ann-Margret (you'll see what I mean if you watch the film) and the incredibly dumb hero played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Again and again and again his dopey schemes fall flat until the movie comes to a very unexpected and funny ending.While I will admit this is more of a kids movie, adults can enjoy it too provided they don't think too much and just sit back and watch with an open mind.",anger

"I like a rip-roaring horror movie as much as the next guy, but this one just didn't do it for me. It certainly felt like it hit all the necessary marks, from nudity and dismemberment to bloody revenge, but at the conclusion, it just felt like eating cotton candy - no real nutritional value, just a sense that I had satisfied some of my prurient appetite without any logical payoff.The movie was slow in getting started and then the sprinted to a singularly boggling ending. I walked out of the theater asking, ""What was the point of all that?"" And while this is described as horror, it really should be classified as thriller. There was no explanation or clever twist at the end. Just the end. I'm sure that it will attract an enthusiastic audience of young adults, but the evisceration by the critics will stem any hopes of huge box office.If your expectations are low enough, and your tastes in gore sufficiently robust, then you are in for a good time. Otherwise, skip this and see a classic Hitchcock film. You'll feel better about yourself.",anger
"Scorsese has such an encyclopedic knowledge and understanding of cinema that every shot, however inventive and daring, is effortlessly composed. The direction, editing and cinematography are all the first-rate work by individuals who are clearly masters of their profession and the production design, costumes and makeup are the best you'll see all year. Their efforts combine to create a world of rich and lavish color, of excitement and glamour. Who wouldn't want to visit THIS Cotton Club in 1935? It's hard to imagine who could trump the technical team for Oscars this year.With such a perfectly realized world in which to perform, the actors universally do an outstanding job. Despite the criticism of the hardcore DiCaprio-haters, the unprejudiced will observe an excellent performance that takes genuine risks and convincingly conveys the passing of more than twenty years. Importantly, DiCaprio more than holds his own when paired with Cate Blanchett and especially Alan Alda, who both give equally note worthy performances. Blanchett's interpretation of Katherine Hepburn seems spot on, and anyone familiar with the late actresses mannerisms will appreciate the hard work that clearly went into the recreation. Alda, one of the most consistently underrated actors around, delivers another masterclass in restrained character building as he oozes ambition and political dishonesty from every pore.And yet, despite the obvious talent of all those involved and Scorsese's ability to effortlessly fill three hours, something about The Aviator fails to completely satisfy. Without wanting to sound like a film student, movies should, ultimately, be ABOUT something; love, honor, courage, redemption, the BIG ideas and themes that are the fuel of the plot. What was the drive of The Aviator? A rich guy recklessly spends lots of money to indulge his personal obsessions and gets away with it. We're never told how his experiences change him, and without change there's no journey. Considering the screenplay was written by John Logan, who usually displays a keen interest in showing the emotional evolution of his characters, the oversight is inexplicable. Ultimately then, much like Gangs of New York, The Aviator is simply the sum of it's parts, and however brilliantly those parts are realized, there doesn't seem to be a bigger theme to underpin and drive them.The Aviator is a perfectly realized recreation of the era and one well worth experiencing. But the lack of a real emotional journey suggests 'all gloss and no substance', and ultimately prevents the movie from being truly great.",anger

"As P strolled the path around the pond, he sniffed the humid air. His kimono brushed the parched ground. The metals of the earth rose up in traces of dust and hints of lightning: a waft of petrichor, the smell before the rain.Beyond the pale hills of his peaceful land, scores of horse soldiers prepared their armor. Soon the soldiers would sweep across the plains, and the dry politics of princely maneuverings would be as rice paper soaked with blood. Instead of petty policies — immensity. Peaceful farmers would be impaled, paltry officials imprisoned — twisted, screaming, then praying. There on the dusty path the young poet P was just perceiving the beforeness of it all, the pre-.From his masters he had learned that immensity makes the small crucial. A little poem before a big war becomes a necessity.And like a small poem on a long scroll, a lily pad appeared on the pond. P stopped to peer. He puzzled through its pattern of green inside green on water.A poem began to perfuse. It was inside P, but it was also on the lily pad.At    ...    On    ...    At first only prepositions came to him.He stared into the water, seeing the silvery clouds reflected. Then he leaned at an extreme angle and noticed the pattern of his gown wavering in the reeds. A pinpoint of a poem stabbed him, like the sharp scent of earth before the rain. Petrichor: before, before.•Then drops pelted the pond, pipped at the pond, plunged toward it, plummeted into it, driving P to take refuge beneath the deep tiled eaves of his house.Inside the sliding paper doors were a desk and a futon. On the desk lay a brush. On the futon lay a lover in uneasy sleep on petal-printed silk.He chose the desk. He lifted the brush while looking down at the restive slumberer. In a mere matter of stopped time he had his poem, written from the very tissues of an arm and hand that could plunge a sword.Silver soldiers masson far horizons, but here,silk pools on the bed.The rain rained; moisture curled the edges of the paper. Seventeen syllables, an epic of energy, made him drowsy and hungry. His lover still asleep, he rose, ate leftover peaches poached in soy sauce and ginger, and, with the rain a drizzle, thought again of his poem. How could he have loved it in the instant after he wrote it, but now be so unsure?He sat at his desk again. Another one? This time he drafted:Poppy? Penis up.Prow into periwinkle.Peony behind.After he calligraphed the puzzle of passion across the page, he woke the one in the pond of pink silk, and they proved it on the futon. He heard the pluvial patter on the eaves, while they angled and slipped, perspiring on silk. The stamping and snorting of the horses sweating in their armor was far too far away to be sensed by P, but he heard. He felt the pond muddied and the roof cracked and the poems scattered. How far was he now from this picture in his mind? He worked to make his pleasure stay, pitiable and small against the portents rising, for P was afraid this afternoon would never be remembered after the bloody conquering.But later the barbarians would bivouac in this house, the pond saved for drinking water, the path roughened by horses, and the reverse of P’s scroll used for another man’s military diary, his afternoon’s foreboding and pleasure a preparation for the future, and in the future, a stay against another’s view of the past.“P from Alphabetique,” 2013 by Kara Kosaka",anger

"I was one of those people that hated everything about Cabin Fever. I wasn't anticipating Eli Roth's next film, but when I heard the Internet buzz around Hostel, and found it was showing at the 2005 TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival), I decided to check it out.Eli Roth, who was at the screening, mentioned to the audience that this was the first public viewing in North America. He also told us what we were about to see was a work in progress print of the film. What I saw was one hell of a fierce horror flick that works on every level.All the actors do a great job in this flick. I was especially impressed with Jay Hernandez, and Derek Richardson, two relatively unknown actors. There are a lot of funny scenes, and dialog in the early parts of the film. It's not that slapstick, forced stuff that was so prevalent in Cabin Fever. There also lots of nudity in the early parts in the film as well. When things begin to turn towards horror, you truly feel the sense of terror the characters are going through. The build up to the climax is just done so well. I loved the fact the story is very believable.Make no mistake about it, this is a violent, sick, and gory flick. It's not for the squeamish. I haven't seen this type of extreme violence in a North America mainstream cinema. The Takashi Miike, and Asian Cinema influences are clearly seen here.This is a film that will shock people, and remain in there heads well after the film is over. It will be interesting to see how the film is edited, and rated. In it's current state, I don't see how it could get anything less than the dreaded NC-17 rating. I just hope that it's not butchered too much, as the audience deserves to see the film how it was intended. Eli Roth has completely redeemed himself for what I thought was a very poor film in Cabin Fever, and has made one kick-ass horror film.",anger

"In the sad November time, When the leaf has left the lime, And the Cam, with sludge and slime,       Plasters his ugly channel, While, with sober step and slow, Round about the marshes low, Stiffening students stumping go       Shivering through their flannel. Then to me in doleful mood Rises up a question rude, Asking what sufficient good       Comes of this mode of living? Moping on from day to day, Grinding up what will not “pay,” Till the jaded brain gives way       Under its own misgiving. Why should wretched Man employ Years which Nature meant for joy, Striving vainly to destroy       Freedom of thought and feeling? Still the injured powers remain Endless stores of hopeless pain, When at last the vanquished brain       Languishes past all healing. Where is then his wealth of mind— All the schemes that Hope designed? Gone, like spring, to leave behind       Indolent melancholy. Thus he ends his helpless days, Vex’t with thoughts of former praise— Tell me, how are Wisdom’s ways       Better than senseless Folly? Happier those whom trifles please, Dreaming out a life of ease, Sinking by unfelt degrees       Into annihilation. Or the slave, to labour born, Heedless of the freeman’s scorn, Destined to be slowly worn       Down to the brute creation. Thus a tempting spirit spoke, As from troubled sleep I woke To a morning thick with smoke,       Sunless and damp and chilly. Then to sleep I turned once more, Eyes inflamed and windpipe sore, Dreaming dreams I dreamt before,       Only not quite so silly. In my dream methought I strayed Where a learned-looking maid Stores of flimsy goods displayed,       Articles not worth wearing. “These,” she said, with solemn air, “Are the robes that sages wear, Warranted, when kept with care,       Never to need repairing.” Then unnumbered witlings, caught By her wiles, the trappings bought, And by labour, not by thought,       Honour and fame were earning. While the men of wiser mind Passed for blind among the blind; Pedants left them far behind       In the career of learning. “Those that fix their eager eyes Ever on the nearest prize Well may venture to despise       Loftier aspirations. Pedantry is in demand! Buy it up at second-hand, Seek no more to understand       Profitless speculations.” Thus the gaudy gowns were sold, Cast off sloughs of pedants old; Proudly marched the students bold       Through the domain of error, Till their trappings, false though fair, Mouldered off and left them bare, Clustering close in blank despair,       Nakedness, cold, and terror. Then, I said, “These haughty Schools Boast that by their formal rules They produce more learned fools       Than could be well expected. Learned fools they are indeed, Learned in the books they read; Fools whene’er they come to need       Wisdom, too long neglected. “Oh! that men indeed were wise, And would raise their purblind eyes To the opening mysteries       Scattered around them ever. Truth should spring from sterile ground, Beauty beam from all around, Right should then at last be found       Joining what none may sever.”",anger

"Almost fascinating in its awfulness. There's very little funny going on in this ""comedy"" full of goofy sound effects, exaggerated facial expressions, dumb slapstick, diarrhea gags, and wacky mix-ups. Stuff like VEER-ZAARA is merely trite and clichéd, but this is painfully obnoxious. I thought Salman Khan was the most ridiculous star in Bollywood, but Aamir Khan (who is great in LAGAAN) matches him every step of the way, both of them being grating knuckleheads (not to mention the horrible fashion sense and bad mullets). The sad thing is there actually are some decent comic ideas in the script, but it's all executed so amateurishly and clearly aimed at the lowest common denominator. There were a few moments I found myself having fun with it, but then something stupid would happen and ruin it all over it again. Even the songs are disappointing. Ugh.",anger

I didn't care about the lead actors, who had very little chemistry in between the sex scenes and even those were pretty dull, the elevator scene is a good example of what I mean. The plot is poor, the drama is rubbish, the acting is wooden, and the dialogue is laughable rubbish. The film is unintentionally funny when supposed to be serious, and boring when supposed to be sexy. Although sexier than the original film (my wife tells me) not as graphically sexy as the book. I sat through the pain of this and at the end felt glad I wasn't Christian Grey, though being a billionaire is always very appealing.

"Aenigma appears to be Lucio Fulci's attempt at 'Suspiria', as the plotting, atmosphere, locations and characters are all similar, and while this isn't essentially a 'bad' film, it certainly has nothing on Dario Argento's masterpiece. The influence from American cinema seems to have affected the great Italian maestro Lucio Fulci on this film, as he uses cheesy eighties songs a lot, and the way the plot plays out feels a lot like an American slasher, with the focus being kept on the kill scenes and bedtime activities of most of the school girls. The film forsakes logic at almost every turn, and much of the plot isn't explained and doesn't make a lot of sense. The central theme of a young, injured, girl possessing several members of her school and taking revenge on those that wronged her springs to mind immediately, as this isn't explained at all and that makes it hard to buy into the film. The way that Fulci handles this plot isn't very good either, as we are never made to care for her plight and therefore the fact that the plot doesn't make sense is made all the more irritating.Fulci does well with the atmosphere in the film, and the cinematography is rather nice also. As you would expect from a director who made his name with a whole load of blood and guts, there is no shortage of death scenes in this film. These scenes range from featuring severed limbs to gratuitous stabbings, but strangely enough; these scenes feel rushed and Fulci doesn't deliver a great deal of gore, which is probably the main reason why this film doesn't often get a very good write-up. Lucio Fulci has a bigger filmography than you would think, and many of his lesser known films - such as The Devil's Honey and Don't Torture a Duckling turn out to be his best. This film, however, is one of the director's more average efforts on the whole. I don't think Fulci really cared too much about the supernatural angle of the story, and so the film has ended up being disjointed and illogical. The acting and dialogue does nothing to alter this fact, as both are poor even for an Italian horror film. To be honest, I don't rate Aenigma as a complete dead loss; although it should be noted that I'm more tolerant of Fulci's films than most.",anger

"In Los Angeles, the PR Marni Olivia Olsen (Kristen Bell) is promoted to VP of the RMK Investment office in New York. She travels first to her hometown to the wedding of her big brother Will (Jimmy Wolk) with his fiancée Joanna (Odette Yustman). On the flight, Marni freaks out when she learns that Joanna is her arch nemesis JJ, who has bullied her in the Ridgefield High School. Marni discovers that her family loves Joanna, and when she meets her, she wants Joanna to apologize for the humiliations she was submitted in the high-school. But Joanna pretends that she has not recognized Marni and promises a fresh start to them. Meanwhile Joanna's aunt Ramona (Sigourney Weaver) arrives for the wedding and Marni's mother Gail Byer (Jamie Lee Curtis) recognizes her as her high-school former friend that has become her enemy. The resented Marni seeks revenge and decides to expose the past of Joanna to Will to protect her brother and force him to call off his wedding while Gail begins a personal dispute with Ramona. ""You Again"" is a movie with a contradictory lead character but a pleasant conclusion. Marni is a loser in high-school and a vengeful woman, and it is hard to like her. Further, how could a woman with a clumsy and imbecile behavior is promoted to VP of a company? No matter how traumatic might have been her life in high-school, it does not justify her jealousy and immature behavior of woman promoted to an executive position, and she does not walk the way she talks in her initial speech. Jamie Lee Curtis and Sigourney Weaver perform strong characters and their competition is funny. And the character of the gorgeous Odette Yustman is not the villain of the story in the end. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Você de Novo"" (""You Again"")",anger

"BOOK SIXChapter XLIVIIn hill-towns, from San Fernando to Mayagüez,   the same sunrise stirred the feathered lances of cane   down the archipelago’s highways. The first breezerattled the spears and their noise was like distant rain   marching down from the hills, like a shell at your ears.   In the cool asphalt Sundays of the Antillesthe light brought the bitter history of sugaracross the squared fields, heightening towards harvest,   to the bleached flags of the Indian diaspora.The drizzling light blew across the savannah   darkening the racehorses’ hides; mist slowly erased   the royal palms on the crests of the hills and thehills themselves. The brown patches the horses had grazed   shone as wet as their hides. A skittish stallion   jerked at his bridle, marble-eyed at the thundermuffling the hills, but the groom was drawing him in   like a fisherman, wrapping the slack line under   one fist, then with the other tightening the reinand narrowing the circle. The sky cracked asunder   and a forked tree flashed, and suddenly that black rain   which can lose an entire archipelagoin broad daylight was pouring tin nails on the roof,   hammering the balcony. I closed the French window,   and thought of the horses in their stalls with one hooftilted, watching the ropes of rain. I lay in bedwith current gone from the bed-lamp and heard the roar   of wind shaking the windows, and I rememberedAchille on his own mattress and desperate Hector   trying to save his canoe, I thought of Helen   as my island lost in the haze, and I was sureI’d never see her again. All of a suddenthe rain stopped and I heard the sluicing of water   down the guttering. I opened the window whenthe sun came out. It replaced the tiny brooms   of palms on the ridges. On the red galvanizedroof of the paddock, the wet sparkled, then the groomsled the horses over the new grass and exercised   them again, and there was a different brightness   in everything, in the leaves, in the horses’ eyes.III smelt the leaves threshing at the top of the year   in green January over the orange villas   and military barracks where the Plunketts were,the harbour flecked by the wind that comes with Christmas,   edged with the Arctic, that was christened Vent Noël;   it stayed until March and, with luck, until Easter.It freshened the cedars, waxed the laurier-cannelle,   and hid the African swift. I smelt the drizzleon the asphalt leaving the Morne, it was the smellof an iron on damp cloth; I heard the sizzle   of fried jackfish in oil with their coppery skin;I smelt ham studded with cloves, the crusted accra,the wax in the varnished parlour: Come in. Come in,   the arm of the Morris chair sticky with lacquer;   I saw a sail going out and a sail coming in,and a breeze so fresh it lifted the lace curtains   like a petticoat, like a sail towards Ithaca;   I smelt a dead rivulet in the clogged drains.IIIAh, twin-headed January, seeing either tense:   a past, they assured us, born in degradation,   and a present that lifted us up with the wind’snoise in the breadfruit leaves with such an elation   that it contradicts what is past! The cannonballs   of rotting breadfruit from the Battle of the Saints,the asterisks of bulletholes in the brick walls   of the redoubt. I lived there with every sense.I smelt with my eyes, I could see with my nostrils.Chapter XLVIOne side of the coast plunges its precipices   into the Atlantic. Turns require wide locks,since the shoulder is sharp and the curve just missesa long drop over the wind-bent trees and the rocks   between the trees. There is a wide view of Dennery,   with its stone church and raw ochre cliffs at whose basethe African breakers end. Across the flecked seawhose combers veil and unveil the rocks with their lace   the next port is Dakar. The uninterrupted windthuds under the wings of frigates, you see them bent   from a force that has crossed the world, tilting to find   purchase in the sudden downdrafts of its current.The breeze threshed the palms on the cool December road   where the Comet hurtled with empty leopard seats,   so fast a man on a donkey trying to readits oncoming fiery sign heard only two thudding beats   from the up-tempo zouk that its stereo playedwhen it screeched round a bridge and began to ascendaway from the palm-fronds and their wickerwork shade   that left the windscreen clear as it locked round the bend,   where Hector suddenly saw the trotting pigletand thought of Plunkett’s warning as he heard it screel   with the same sound that the tires of the Cometmade rounding the curve from the sweat-greased steering wheel.The rear wheels spin to a dead stop, like a helm.   The piglet trots down the safer side of the road.Lodged in their broken branches the curled letters flame.Hector had both hands on the wheel. His head was bowed   under the swaying statue of the Madonna   of the Rocks, her smile swayed under the blue hood,and when her fluted robe stilled, the smile stayed on her   dimpled porcelain. She saw, in the bowed man, the calm   common oval of prayer, the head’s usual angleover the pew of the dashboard. Her lifted palm,   small as a doll’s from its cerulean mantle,   indicated that he had prayed enough to the laceof foam round the cliff’s altar, that now, if he wished,   he could lift his head, but he stayed in the same place,   the way a man will remain when Mass is finished,not unclenching his hands or freeing one to cross   forehead, heart, and shoulders swiftly and then kneel   facing the altar. He bowed in endless remorse,for her mercy at what he had done to Achille,   his brother. But his arc was over, for the course   of every comet is such. The fated crescentwas printed on the road by the scorching tires.A salt tear ran down the porcelain cheek and it wentin one slow drop to the clenched knuckle that still grippedthe wheel. On the flecked sea, the uninterrupted   wind herded the long African combers, and whipped   the small flag of the island on its silver spearhead.IIDrivers leant over the rail. One seized my luggage   off the porter’s cart. The rest burst into patois,   with gestures of despair at the lost privilegeof driving me, then turned to other customers.In the evening pastures horses grazed, their hides wet   with light that shot its lances over the combers.I had the transport all to myself.                                                   “You all set?Good. A good pal of mine died in that chariot   of his called the Comet.”                                     He turned in the front seat,spinning the air with his free hand. I sat, sprawled out   in the back, discouraging talk, with my crossed feet.   “You never know when, eh? I was at the airportthat day. I see him take off like a rocket.I always said that thing have too much horsepower.   And so said, so done. The same hotel, chief, correct?”I saw the coastal villages receding asthe highway’s tongue translated bush into forest,   the wild savannah into moderate pastures,that other life going in its “change for the best,”   its peace paralyzed in a postcard, a concrete   future ahead of it all, in the cinder-blocksof hotel development with the obsoletecraft of the carpenter, as I sensed, in the neat   marinas, the fisherman’s phantom. Old oarlocksand rusting fretsaw. My craft required the same   crouching care, the same crabbed, natural devotion   of the hand that stencilled a flowered window-frameor planed an elegant canoe; its time was gone   with the spirit in the wood, as wood grew obsoleteand plasterers smoothed the blank page of white concrete.I watched the afternoon sea. Didn’t I want the poor   to stay in the same light so that I could transfix   them in amber, the afterglow of an empire,preferring a shed of palm-thatch with tilted sticks   to that blue bus-stop? Didn’t I prefer a roadfrom which tracks climbed into the thickening syntaxof colonial travellers, the measured prose I readas a schoolboy? That cove, with its brown shallows   there, Praslin? That heron? Had they waited for meto develop my craft? Why hallow that pretence   of preserving what they left, the hypocrisy   of loving them from hotels, a biscuit-tin fencesmothered in love-vines, scenes to which I was attached   as blindly as Plunkett with his remorseful research?   Art is History’s nostalgia, it prefers a thatchedroof to a concrete factory, and the huge churchabove a bleached village. The gap between the driver   and me increased when he said:                                              “The place changing, eh?”where an old rumshop had gone, but not that riverwith its clogged shadows. That would make me a stranger.   “All to the good,” he said. I said, “All to the good,”then, “whoever they are,” to myself. I caught his eyes   in the mirror. We were climbing out of Micoud.   Hadn’t I made their poverty my paradise?His back could have been Hector’s, ferrying tourists   in the other direction home, the leopard seatscratching their damp backs like the fur-covered armrests.He had driven his burnt-out cargo, tired of sweat,who longed for snow on the moon and didn’t have to face   the heat of that sinking sun, who knew a climateas monotonous as this one could only produce   from its unvarying vegetation flashes   of a primal insight like those red-pronged liliesthat shot from the verge, that their dried calabashes   of fake African masks for a fake Achillesrattled with the seeds that came from other men’s minds.So let them think that. Who needed art in this place   where even the old women strode with stiff-backed spines,   and the fishermen had such adept thumbs, such gracethese people had, but what they envied most in them   was the calypso part, the Caribbean lilt   still in the shells of their ears, like the surf’s rhythm,until too much happiness was shadowed with guilt   like any Eden, and they sighed at the sign:   HEWANNORRA (Iounalao), the gold seaflat as a credit-card, extending its lineto a beach that now looked just like everywhere else,   Greece or Hawaii. Now the goddamn souvenirfelt absurd, excessive. The painted gourds, the shells.   Their own faces as brown as gourds. Mine felt as strange   as those at the counter feeling their bodies change.IIIChange lay in our silence. We had come to that bend   where the trees are warped by wind, and the cliffs, raw,   shelve surely to foam.                                 “Is right here everything end,”the driver said, and rammed open the transport door   on his side, then mine.                                  “Anyway, chief, the view nice.”   I joined him at the gusting edge.                                                 “His name was Hector.”The name was bent like the trees on the precipice   to point inland. In its echo a man-o’-warscreamed on the wind. The driver moved off for a piss,then shouted over his shoulder:                                              “A road-warrior.He would drive like a madman when the power took.   He had a nice woman. Maybe he died for her.”For her and tourism, I thought. The driver shook   himself, zipping then hoisting his crotch.                                                               “Crazy, but   a gentle fellow anyway, with a very good brain.”Cut to a leopard galloping on a dry plain   across Serengeti. Cut to the spraying fans   drummed by a riderless stallion, its wild manescaring the Scamander. Cut to a woman’s handsclenched towards her mouth with no sound. Cut to the wheel   of a chariot’s spiked hubcap. Cut to the faceof his muscling jaw, then flashback to Achille   hurling a red tin and a cutlass. Next, a vase   with a girl’s hoarse whisper echoing “Omeros,”as in a conch-shell. Cut to a shield of silver   rolling like a hubcap. Rewind, in slow motion,   myrmidons gathering by a village riverwith lances for oars. Cut to the surpliced ocean   droning its missal. Cut. A crane hoisting a wreck.   A horse nosing the surf, then shuddering its neck.He’d paid the penalty of giving up the seaas graceless and as treacherous as it had seemed,   for the taxi-business; he was making money,but all of that money was making him ashamed   of the long afternoons of shouting by the wharf   hustling passengers. He missed the uncertain sandunder his feet, he sighed for the trough of a wave,   and the jerk of the oar when it turned in his hand,   and the rose conch sunset with its low pelicans.Castries was corrupting him with its roaring life,   its littered market, with too many transport vans   competing. Castries had been his common-law wifewho, like Helen, he had longed for from a distance,   and now he had both, but a frightening discontent   hollowed his face; to find that the sea was a lovehe could never lose made every gesture violent:   ramming the side-door shut, raking the clutch. He drove   as if driven by furies, but furies paid the rent.A man who cursed the sea had cursed his own mother.   Mer was both mother and sea. In his lost canoe   he had said his prayers. But now he was in anotherkind of life that was changing him with his brand-new   stereo, its endless garages, where he could notwhip off his shirt, hearing the conch’s summoning note.Chapter XLVIIHector was buried near the sea he had loved once.   Not too far from the shallows where he fought Achille   for a tin and Helen. He did not hear the sea-almond’smoan over the bay when Philoctete blew the shell,   nor the one drumbeat of a wave-thud, nor a sail   rattling to rest as its day’s work was over,and its mate, gauging depth, bent over the gunwale,   then wearily sounding the fathoms with an oar,the same rite his shipmates would repeat soon enoughwhen it was their turn to lie quiet as Hector,   lowering a pitch-pine canoe in the earth’s trough,to sleep under the piled conchs, through every weatheron the violet-wreathed mound. Crouching for his friend to hear,   Achille whispered about their ancestral river,   and those things he would recognize when he got there,his true home, forever and ever and ever,   forever, compère. Then Philoctete limped over   and rested his hand firmly on a shaking shoulderto anchor his sorrow. Seven Seas and Helen   did not come nearer. Achille had carried an oarto the church and propped it outside with the red tin.Now his voice strengthened. He said: “Mate, this is your spear,”and laid the oar slowly, the same way he had placed   the parallel oars in the hull of the gommierthe day the African swift and its shadow raced.And this was the prayer that Achille could not utter:   “The spear that I give you, my friend, is only wood.Vexation is past. I know how well you treat her.   You never know my admiration, when you stood   crossing the sun at the bow of the long canoewith the plates of your chest like a shield; I would say   any enemy so was a compliment. ’Cause no   African ever hurled his wide seine at the bayby which he was born with such beauty. You hear me? Men   did not know you like me. All right. Sleep good. Good night.”   Achille moved Philoctete’s hand, then he saw Helenstanding alone and veiled in the widowing light.   Then he reached down to the grave and lifted the tin   to her. Helen nodded. A wind blew out the sun.IIPride set in Helen’s face after this, like a stone   bracketed with Hector’s name; her lips were incised   by its dates in parenthesis. She seemed more stern,more ennobled by distance as she slowly crossed   the hot street of the village like a distant sailon the horizon. Grief heightened her. When she smiledit was with such distance that it was hard to tellif she had heard your condolence. It was the child,   Ma Kilman told them, that made her more beautiful.IIIThe rites of the island were simplified by its elements,which changed places. The grooved sea was Achille’s garden,   the ridged plot of rattling plantains carried their senseof the sea, and Philoctete, on his height, often heard, in   a wind that suddenly churned the rage of deep gorges,   the leafy sound of far breakers plunging with smoke,and for smoke there were the bonfires which the sun catches   on the blue heights at sunrise, doing the same work   as Philoctete clearing his plot, just as, at sunset,smoke came from the glowing rim of the horizon as if   from his enamel pot. The woodsmoke smelt of a regret   that men cannot name. On the charred field, the massivesawn trunks burnt slowly like towers, and the greatindigo dusk slowly plumed down, devouring the still leaves,   igniting the firefly huts, lifting the panicky egretto beat its lagoon and shelve in the cage of the mangroves,   take in the spars of its sails, then with quick-pricking head   anchor itself shiftingly, and lift its question again.At night, the island reversed its elements, the heron   of a quarter-moon floated from Hector’s grave, rain   rose upwards from the sea, and the corrugated ironof the sea glittered with nailheads. Raggedplantains bent and stepped with their rustling powers   over the furrows of Philoctete’s garden, a chorus of agedancestors and straw, and, rustling, surrounded every house   in the village with its back garden, with its rank middenof rusted chamber pots, rotting nets, and the moon’s cold basin.They sounded, when they shook, after the moonlit meridian   of their crossing, like the night-surf; they gazed in   silence at the shadows of their lamplit children.At Philoctete, groaning and soaking the flower on his shin   with hot sulphur, cleaning its edges with yellow Vaseline,   and, gripping his knee, squeezing rags from the basin.At night, when yards are asleep, and the broken lineof the surf hisses like Philo, “Bon Dieu, aie, waie, my sin   is this sore?” the old plantains suffer and shine.Chapter XLVIIIIslands of bay leaves in the medicinal bath   of a cauldron, a sibylline cure. The citron   sprig of a lime-tree dividing the sky in halfdipped its divining rod. The white spray of the thorn,   which the swift bends lightly, waited for a black hand   to break it in bits and boil its leaves for the woundfrom the pronged anchor rusting in clean bottom-sand.   Ma Kilman, in a black hat with its berried fringe,   eased herself sideways down the broken concrete stepof the rumshop’s back door, closed it, and rammed the hinge   tight. The bolt caught a finger and with that her instep   arch twisted and she let out a soft Catholiccurse, then crossed herself. She closed the gate. The asphalt   sweated with the heat, the limp breadfruit leaves were thick   over the fence. Her spectacles swam in their sweat.She plucked an armpit. The damn wig was badly made.   She was going to five o’clock Mass, to la Messe,   and sometimes she had to straighten it as she prayeduntil the wafer dissolved her with tenderness,the way a raindrop melts on the tongue of a breeze.In the church’s cool cave the sweat dried from her eyes.She rolled down the elastic bands below the knees   of her swollen stockings. It was then that their vise   round her calves reminded her of Philoctete. Then,numbering her beads, she began her own litany   of berries, Hail Mary marigolds that stiffen   their aureoles in the heights, mild anemoneand clear watercress, the sacred heart of Jesus   pierced like the anthurium, the thorns of logwood,   called the tree of life, the aloe good for seizures,the hole in the daisy’s palm, with its drying blood   that was the hole in the fisherman’s shin since he was   pierced by a hook; there was the pale, roadside tisaneof her malarial childhood. There was this onefor easing a birth-breach, that one for a love-bath,   before the buds of green sugar-apples in the sunripened like her nipples in girlhood. But what path   led through nettles to the cure, the furious sibyl   couldn’t remember. Mimosa winced from her fingers,shutting like jalousies at some passing evilwhen she reached for them. The smell of incense lingers   in her clothes. Inside, the candle-flames are erectround the bier of the altar while she and her friends   old-talk on the steps, but the plant keeps its secret   when her memory reaches, shuttering in its fronds.IIThe dew had not yet dried on the white-ribbed awnings   and the nodding palanquins of umbrella yams   where the dark grove had not heat but early morningsof perpetual freshness, in which the bearded arms   of a cedar held council. Between its gnarled toesgrew the reek of an unknown weed; its pronged flowersprang like a buried anchor; its windborne odours   diverted the bee from its pollen, but its power,rooted in bitterness, drew her bowed head by the noseas a spike does a circling bull. To approach itMa Kilman lowered her head to one side and screened   the stench with a cologned handkerchief. The mulch itwas rooted in carried the smell, when it gangrened,   of Philoctete’s cut. In her black dress, her berried   black hat, she climbed a goat-path up from the village,past the stones with dried palms and conchs, where the buried   suffer the sun all day Sunday, while goats forage   the new wreaths. Once more she pulled at the itch in herarmpits, nearly dropping her purse. Then she climbed hard   up the rain-cracked path, the bay closing behind her   like a wound, and rested. Everything that echoedrepeated its outline: a goat’s doddering bleat,a hammer multiplying a roof, and, through the back yards,   a mother cursing a boy too nimble to beat.Ma Kilman picked up her purse and sighed on upwards   to the thread of the smell, one arm behind her back,   passing the cactus, the thorn trees, and then the woodappeared over her, thick green, the green almost black   as her dress in its shade, its border of flowersflecking the pasture with spray. Then she staggered backfrom the line of ants at her feet. She saw the course   they had kept behind her, following her from church,   signalling a language she could not recognize.IIIA swift had carried the strong seed in its stomach   centuries ago from its antipodal shore,skimming the sea-troughs, outdarting ospreys, her luckheld to its shadow. She aimed to carry the cure   that precedes every wound; the reversible Bight   of Benin was her bow, her target the ringed hazeof a circling horizon. The star-grains at night   made her hungrier; the leafless sea with no house   for her weariness. Sometimes she dozed in her flightfor a swift’s second, closing the seeds of her stare,then ruddering straight. The dry sea-flakes whitened her   breast, her feathers thinned. Then, one dawn the day-starrose slowly from the wrong place and it frightened her   because all the breakers were blowing from the wrong   east. She saw the horned island and uncurled her clawswith one frail cry, since swifts are not given to song,   and fluttered down to a beach, ejecting the seed   in grass near the sand. She nestled in dry seaweed.In a year she was bleached bone. All of that motion   a pile of fragile ash from the fire of her will,   but the vine grew its own wings, out of the oceanit climbed like the ants, the ancestors of Achille,   the women carrying coals after the dark door   slid over the hold. As the weed grew in odourso did its strength at the damp root of the cedar,   where the flower was anchored at the mottled root   as a lizard crawled upwards, foot by sallow foot.",anger

"Leave it to Martin Scorsese, he is one of the few reliable directors who graces in age, still manages to make outstanding movies. I thought his previous film; GANGS OF NEW YORK was the best film of 2002 (and still stand by that comment). Scorsese who was once known for showing us the gritty realistic world of New York City's ""Mean Streets"" with the Little Italy thugs (MEAN STREETS), anti-hero loners (TAXI DRIVER), fallen hero (RAGING BULL), bizarre world of Soho (AFTER HOURS), realistic thugs (GOODFELLAS), gangsters controlling Las Vegas (CASINO; it wasn't in NYC, but it still had the similar theme), guilt ridden paramedic (BRINGING OUT THE DEAD), and the war between immigrants (GANGS OF NEW YORK). This is the Scorsese that all of us know about and remember. Yet Scorsese was also responsible for telling us about a single mother in the southwest struggling to survive (ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE), the final farewell concert of a fantastic rock/folk group The Band (THE LAST WALTZ), and the story of Jesus Christ (LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ). Now Scorsese has become the storyteller of one of the most enthusiastic and eccentric billionaires of recent years, Howard Hughes.In THE AVIATOR, Scorsese portrays Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) as several different roles: filmmaker, womanizer, entrepreneur, engineer, germ-phobic, and aviator. The film tells about the achievements that Hughes accomplished such as the movies HELL'S ANGELS & THE OUTLAW, the building of an airplane that can fly above 20,000 feet, acquiring TWA and making it a international airline, and the design and building of the largest airplane ever the Hercules (now known as the Spruce Goose). Yet Hughes went through so many conflicts with his business: Pan Am Airline chief Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin), Maine Senator Ralph Owen Brewster (Alan Alda), Louis B. Mayer (Stanley DeSantis); his romance: Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsdale); and himself: paranoia, and obsession compulsion disorder.THE AVIATOR discusses all of those elements in rich detail, that after watching the movie, you begin to realize the amazing accomplishments that Hughes did. Wonder why the only thing we most remember about Hughes was being a recluse who was afraid of germs. And would like to know more about Howard Hughes and see the films that were discussed in the film.This isn't a Scorsese film that people want another TAXI DRIVER, GOODFELLAS, CASINO, or RAGING BULL would expect. This is a different kind of Scorsese, one who is telling a story about a man, who is no different that him. A dreamer who dreams big and ignores what his advisors, and partners tell him, then come up with projects with amazing results. DiCaprio proves that he his under-appreciated actor in this film. While most of the public see him as that goofy kid who shouts, ""I'm king of the world!"" in TITANIC. Yet most don't realize his talent with such roles as in WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE and CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. THE AVIATOR shows that DiCaprio is a great actor, giving a realistic portrayal of the eccentric Hughes in some scenes, and a man who cleanses the germs that represent people he dislikes or negative incidents. Blanchett does a amazing job with her performance of Katherine Hepburn with the way her head is tilted back to the pronunciation of words to the snobbish like personality she has when she is around her parents. While Beckinsdale also does a great job playing the very sexy Ava Gardner who has a love/hate relationship with Hughes, a woman who hates him at times, but will help him when he needs help.The supporting performances by John C. Reily, Ian Holm, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Danny Huston, and Matt Ross are all top rate and also deserve recognition as well.And Scorsese proves that he one of the best directors of all time with several elements. First the pacing of the story, the film never drags and at running time of 169 mins. it kept my attention on what was going to be happening next. Second, some of the scenes of the film were of complete beauty and wonder. One scene that blew my mind was during the filming of the aerial scenes from HELLS ANGELS which showed how dangerous it was filming the dogfight scenes from that film, seventy years before computer generated images would replace that technique. Third, the acting by the actors was top notch and very convincing. Finally, the story of Howard Hughes himself was unique and original and I think there will never be another person like Howard Hughes. This has been quite a year of movies: COLLATERAL, SIDEWAYS, KILL BILL VOL. 2, THE INCREDIBLES, RAY, A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT, THE TERMINAL, FAHRENHEIT 9/11, BOURNE SUPREMENCY, OCEANS TWELVE, CRIMINAL, SPIDER-MAN 2, MEAN GIRLS, HARRY POTTER & PRISONER OF AZKABAN, and SPANGLISH were all films that were amazing and all were among my favorite films of this year (yet I still need to see LIFE AQUATIC and FINDING NEVERLAND). But I think it will be hard to beat THE AVIATOR, for it's story, characters, and epic feel. The Academy has snubbed Scorsese for 30 years; they did the same thing for Roman Polanski until THE PIANIST. Now I think its time for the Academy to acknowledge Scorsese for his craft and technique. While some people will believe that Scorsese should have won his Oscar back in 1980 with RAGING BULL, or in 1990 with GOODFELLAS, I feel that it's time to recognize Scorsese for something! And THE AVIATOR is one film that I think that most Scorsese devotees (like myself) feel is worthy of recognition. Plus, if this movie wins both Best Director and Best Picture, then two of my favorite directors will win Oscars (Scorsese and Michael Mann, who produced AVIATOR).So that is why I am rooting and hoping that THE AVIATOR will collect Oscar gold. The best movie of the year, and don't miss it!!!!! ***** (Out of five)",anger

"Tashan - the title itself explains the nature of the movie.This type of movies are actually made for flop. What a shame that Yash Raj Films produces such movies those are worthless than C-grade movies. Or even some C-grade movies have better and pleasing story than Tashan. The much hyped and over-confidently promoted Tashan poorly bombed at the box-office which it certainly deserved.In my view, this is the worst movie ever made from honourable Yash Raj Films' banner. How come they handled such a heavy project to new Vijay Krishna Acharya who has no actual sense of making action flick? He tried to imitate Sanjay Gadhvi's ways of making like Dhoom but he suffered at last. The action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for exhausting the audiences.The story also loses in its meaning and substances to tenderly win the audiences' hearts. In most scenes Anil Kapoor reminds me of southern Tamil star Rajnikant in his body languages and wordly expressions. I am not a fan of neither Saif nor Akshay, but the award of Kareena should have finally gone to Saif''s hand instead of Akshay. Just from the starting point I expected of it, but at the end it displeased me with the climax truth. Saif is the main behind the whole adventure, while Akshay joins in the midst. In any movie, the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit. And Tashan loses in this way, and unexpectedly failed to become a hit.Akshay's has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies. He seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again. In between Saif did a great job in Race, and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie. But he has fully developed himself in the acting field. And last but not the least about Kareena. She looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean. But I myself don't think so, instead she became slim. Yes slim!!! it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people (or say, male). Beside them it is nice that Saif's son Ibrahim appears in the beginning & last as young Saif. I hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his career.Those who like this Tashan they are either mentally immatured or still want to go back to childhood, or say want to be admitted in an asylum. Thumbs down to debutante director Vijay Krishna Acharya who mishandled the project offered by Yash Raj Films. In future he should experiment and study the script minimum of 5 years before going into practical directions.Sorry, I don't like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies.",anger

"'MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS': Two Stars (Out of Five)An indie drama flick; about the lives of several different mothers, and their daughters (told in interwoven stories). The film was directed by first time feature filmmakers Paul Duddridge and Nigel Levy; and it was written by Paige Cameron, also making her feature film debut, and Duddridge ('based on a concept by'). It stars Selma Blair, Mira Sorvino, Sharon Stone, Courteney Cox, Christina Ricci, Alexandra Daniels, Susan Sarandon and Eva Amurri (Sarandon's real life daughter, playing her daughter in the film). The movie received really poor reviews from critics, and this is one film I definitely agree with them on.The movie tells the story of many different women, struggling with real world problems. These problems include work, men, and family relationships. The film (obviously) centers on the relationships between the mothers and their daughters (of course). All of the stories are interwoven, and many are shown through the photography of Rigby Grey (Blair); who is an expecting mother herself. While the cast is all extremely talented, their performances here are pretty weak; obviously due to a terrible script, and really bad directing. The filmmakers are all amateurs, and it shows, but the directors do have a great deal of TV experience, and that shows as well. The movie feels a lot like a 'Lifetime Movie of the Week'; and that's really sad, given all of the good actresses involved. The film obviously had good intentions, and movies focusing on real women (and their daily struggles) are really rare, so it's disappointing that this film misses it's mark (so excessively).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/lcZBQp0HBZg",anger

"Sound familiar? A successful woman gets caught up in the grasp of a seductive, powerful man, they fall in something like love, and then she sees that he is actually a violent jerk (like, kicking the butt of a stranger for looking too long and close at his car). They break up, but he won't let go, bringing her and her previous (and now again) boyfriend into his snarl of sneaky tactics. If it does, it's because, well, this was really not that different than what one saw earlier this year with The Boy Next Door - another painfully generic title for a lame movie - only there it was a teenager in place of a successful-in-business sociopath, and here it's a little more white collar-world (think, in the log-line-comparison term for a studio, Boy Next Door meets 2009's Obsession).In other words, it's trash. It's enjoyable to a point, Sanaa Lathan and Morris Chestnut are (or try to be) real actors with Tyger Williams' script, which seems cooked up from so many parts (or just a clone) of Lifetime movies-of-the-week, and yet there is Michael Ealy to shake things up. As a villain, this guy is almost as intense as Klaus Kinski, though mostly it's in the eyes and face. He may be the only one really making some kind of effort here, though whether that's on Rosenthal telling him to go 'bigger', or just his way of dealing with the limited range of the character, is hard to say.How the filmmakers frame him most times is part of it - that is, when he's working out or glowering in his concrete home (he even has a cat that he pets, albeit not really his). The only thing in fact this has over Boy Next Door is the villain being SO over the top with how he reacts to things, how major the signs come - at first, yes, he may appear charming, and then with the flick of one scene at a gas station he turns into a killer out of every generic horror movie you've ever seen (this time with extra surveillance capabilities, so why not throw in a touch of The Gift in there while you're lifting movies).This is basically in theaters to fill up the space that last year No Good Deed made, though that had the benefit of Idris Elba of all actors in the lead (a movie too good for him, yet made better by him). The Perfect Guy is slickly made but poorly produced, there to generate the most basic, shrill theatrics and thrills for audiences who don't really care for much dimension outside of telegraphed emotions and cheese. And yet, all this said, if one wants bad-movie-cheese, this is certainly a good/bad one to take in; perhaps it's better at home or on Netflix to throw some commentary while watching. As I can attest being in a theater with rowdy, 'Into-it' people, it's not a movie that really begs for silent, contemplative interaction. This is a movie for the crowd that exclaims every other moment at something on the screen, worthy of it or not. Easy, ridiculous, boiler-plate bait for hungry fish.",sadness

A scene where ,Mansukh' father is being happy when his son scolds him for making silent call, is touchy. Climax is very boring and repetitive. The name of film according to content is 100% irrelevant. It is kept to consider a particular section of audience. Dialogues by Bunty Rathore is good among story and screenplay. It generates the required laughter. Performance wise Akshay Kumar is good. Himesh REshamiya is OK. Asin is so so. Mithun Da is very good. Famous and adorable female comedian, Bharti is also in movie but totally wasted. She is fantabulous performer but nothing to do in this film. Music by Himesh Reshamiya is good.

"The ending is heartwarming and there are a few standout scenes here - Charlie's song and dance at the end, his rollerskating through the department store, and the factory machine feeding early on, but otherwise it is short on laughs, and the story feels like some loosely pieced together fragments that don't totally belong together.The 1930's camera seems drunk on its ability to move freely, and as such can't stand still, panning slightly this way and that, and dollying when there is no cause to, and all the while being completely unable to mask the lack of laughs - the complete opposite of Charlie's best work, which could make you laugh despite the most simple of camera set ups.It is also difficult to believe the lead female is in poverty. She is made up, beautiful, dressed nicely enough, and has a face full of laughter and charisma - impossible to believe the circumstances of her life have been too difficult, as the film wishes us too. The apparent confusion on whether it ought to be a silent or sound film adds to the problems, sometimes giving title cards and sometimes spoken word, and to top it all off, even Charlie's performance is not at his usual high standard - tending to overplay things.Thematically it is splitting. On the one hand it may be an argument for creativity and individuality amongst a rigid, soul-sucking, mechanical world - and this is a fine message - but on the other hand it glorifies thieves. All things considered, I would say modernization did not suit Charlie very well.",sadness

"Somewhere . . . somehow . . . one of the finest short SF stories ever to be penned was brutally transmorgrified into a mishmosh of New Age symbolism heavily overlaid with bad acting.  Asimov's original story was a well crafted tale of slowly consuming fear over a natural event.  Mayersberg's film version by rights should have been a major genre event.  Instead we find veteran character actors such as Sarah Douglas and Alexis Kanner (who should've known better) trying to shore up one of the worst David Birney performances ever filmed.  Only two things can be recommended about this film: an interesting poster, and the fact that it was filmed in and around Paolo Soleri's ""Arcosanti"" architectural project out in Arizona.",sadness
"It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see ""The English Patient"" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In ""The Talented Mr Ripley"" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In ""Breaking And Entering"" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in ""The English Patient"", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a ""Minghellian"" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience. He knew how to push our buttons without betraying his own. There is something clear, honest and startling about Minghella's opus. I miss him already but I'm grateful for the reflection of his soul he left behind.",sadness

"Director Mr. Anthony D'Souza's work is not impressive. He fails badly to convey the emotions, particularly. It is official remake of a Malyalam movie Pokkiri Raja but story-writing credit is given to writer duo Farhad Sajid. Screenplay is not good but few shots are good and innovative, i.e creating recliner sofa by humans, jogging on truck. Film is full of illogical scenes in the name of Masala film. Comedy is also very subdued. Dialogues are good at places. It is a typical formula film, some fight, some comedy with forced and badly established emotions. Heroine gets introduced in bikini. They try hard to make audiences emotional but I couldn't relate with any emotional scenes. love track is also not exciting. Performance wise all are OK. Some veteran actors are wasted like Mithun Chakraborty, Parikshit Sahni and Dany Danzongpa. Akash Dabadhe as Vishal (Minister's son) is very good. Party all night song is foot tapping.",sadness
"This short is based on a morality play written by a German baker-turned-soldier, Klaus Erlichmann, who was captured by the French during the Battle of Verdun in the First World War. He wrote it in POW camp to thank God for sparing his life, and upon his release at war's end, the play enjoyed wide popularity in the avant garde theaters of Weimar Germany. Unfortunately, it was targeted by the Nazis in the 1930's during their push to eradicate ""degenerate"" art, and the only surviving copy was smuggled out of Germany hidden inside, appropriately enough, a loaf of bread. It found its way to the United States just as the war broke out and was revived for the stage by Bertolt Brecht in the early 1940's. A representative of DuPont Chemicals was in the audience one evening and, struck by the complex interplay of light and dark, bought the rights to make the film. This is the result.A devil, Red, and an angel, Whitey, battle for the soul of Bill, a bread deliveryman. Whitey is confident that Bill will walk the straight and narrow, so much so that she dares try to tempt him away herself. Red is never far off, watching as Bill endures Whitey's assault on his work ethic, waiting to welcome him into bad deliveryman Hell. In the end, Bill emerges triumphant, explaining how a good bread deliveryman does his job and why he will never do otherwise. Light banishes Dark. Hope is restored. Bread is delivered.The movie resonated throughout the world of international cinema immediately. Only a year after the film's premier, Carl Theodor Dreyer unveiled his own meditation on the dichotomy of faith, ""Ordet"". Ingmar Bergman cited ""Out of This World"" as a heavy influence on 1963's ""Winter Light"" in an interview with an obscure Latvian film magazine. And finally, its immortality was ensured when it was picked up by the Mystery Science Theater 3000 crew for some hilarious ribbing.",sadness
"When ""Twilight"" came out back in 2008 I became immensely curious in the franchise (even though I'd never read the books) due to the overwhelming hype from the fans. After the viewing I felt that the film was left very hollow and weighed down by the sub-standard acting, iffy directing, sloppy editing and overall adolescent melodrama. It felt incomplete but as though it wanted its creators to try harder and become a developed rendition of the books. Regardless, I saw the possibility of potential and found myself interested in seeing where the series would go in the future. ""New Moon"" was released last year and I had actually bubbled up a sense of excitement from watching the trailers. It came off as a new and improved version of the original with a much more interesting story; I couldn't have hit further from the mark if I tried. Completely immersed underneath terrible acting, absolutely sloppy editing, gut-wrenching writing, mediocre directing, god awful story development, empty CGI and a go-nowhere-at-all story only meant to tug at the heart strings of pre-teens, ""New Moon"" was instantly put on the list of worst films I had ever seen in my life. I had become completely turned off by the idea of seeing this franchise grow any further. Alas, my OCD personality refuses to let me start a film series and walk away from it so it was inevitable that I hesitantly saw ""The Twilight Saga: Eclipse"".Almost immediately I realized that this film's atmosphere is a barricaded roundabout of re-hashed dialogue and one-track character directory. Nothing intellectual or invitingly new is dropped into this pot of love triangles, cardboard characters, and afterthought plot development. It's one of the largest problems with the film; nothing is unique. The seemingly ""main story"" is introduced slowly over the course of almost two hours through five to ten minute segments that feel like nothing more than meaningless bursts to keep people on their toes. These sporadic bursts of story come at you in between the same drivel we've heard in ""New Moon"". Bella (Kirsten Stewart) to Edward (Robert Pattinson) to Jacob (Taylor Lautner) back to Bella and Edward and Edward to Jacob and Jacob to Bella and Edward and Jacob and Bella to Edward. Continuously talking about fighting for their love and no sex before marriage and preparing for battle but really doing nothing and ""She loves me but she's too afraid to admit it"" and ""She loves me more but I'm not sure about myself."" It's this childlike, empty conversation between characters with similarly empty, childlike personalities that makes the entire movie feel like a giant fantasy advertisement; an enormous, over dramatic, pre-teen wet dream.The characters are the second biggest issue with this film and even though in second place, it's by far the most irritating problem. I cannot recall the last time I cared for characters so little in a series of any sort. This movie has a running time of an hour and fifty-five minutes, minus the credits and not once do any of the characters deviate from the one-tone personalities that are painted for them. The same over the top emotions that cause the same loop-de-loop interactions that actually get so bad that you feel as though you're watching the same scene over and over and over and over again. It's cursed by a formula that should have been dropped after the first film because there was potential to create characters an audience would be interested in but that ship sailed and crashed; no survivors.Alongside cookie cutter personalities and what tries to pass off as an in-depth story of revenge, love and redemption, is a near beautiful but one dimensional environment. I was really confused by this film's physical appearance and the tone it was attempting to create. The scenery is something to behold but is masked by too much use of blue tones, bloom lights and green washing. The werewolves have got some excellent CGI going for them and at first glance you wouldn't be able to guess that they aren't real. As the film progresses though, you begin to lose the feeling of reality with these creatures. It's almost as if they aren't there and there's no physical depth or strength to them. This weightlessness become very apparent during the overwhelmingly dull, cliché and emotionless fight scenes. Everything about the atmosphere contradicts itself and this became very frustrating to watch. I do have to give credit to the film makers for putting enough effort into making the environment look much more attractive than the previous installments.Overall most of what made ""New Moon"" a total catastrophe has been worked on in ""Eclipse"" and it is indeed a better film than its predecessors. The problem with this analysis is you're comparing one personal experience with a train wreck to another; in the end it's still covered in smoke, fire, dismay and you're hoping to get out alive. The acting has improved but the delivery of almost the entirety of the film's dialogue is rubbish or cringe worthy. The editing has gotten better and the pacing feels more cinematic but the story itself completely veils this upgrade, making it nearly unnoticeable. Changing the directors was possibly the best choice made here because the film feels much more professional and mature; again though, we're talking train wrecks here. If you're a fan of the series thus far, I'm sure you'll enjoy this installment. If you're a fan of the books, maybe you will too. If you're anybody else I would highly suggest, at this point, steering clear of this series entirely and maybe picking up the books.",sadness

"It's usually a pleasure for me to find a foreign (non-Hollywood) film in the Hollywood predominated IMDb's Top 250 list. A foreign film adds to the genuineness and reliability of the list I believe. So far non-Hollywood movies I watched from the list had confirmed my belief e.g., Old boy (South Korean), The Bicycle Thief (Italian), the lives of others (German). This first Swedish movie I watched however proved to be one of the major disappointments for me. Don't be fooled by all the glowing reviews it got or numerous awards it bagged. It's a highly over-rated silly movie. Not only is this movie unfit for the list, it is a below average movie, if you ask me! There isn't a clear demarking line to whether to categorize this movie as a horror movie or a romantic movie but either way I found it to be a poorly made, poorly acted flick.If you are a serious movie viewer; sorry, ""Let the right one in"" is definitely not for you! The plot is unusually dull and ridiculous (I considered not finishing it a couple of times), the acting is awful, and the filming is less than desirable. The two child leads are super boring and non charismatic, you would wonder if they could at the very least find two attractive kids to play the role. It's that kind of movie which you are watching hopelessly thinking something good will happen, but NOTHING HAPPENS, NOTHING!! Well, I don't want to scare you but given the super boringness of the plot and awfulness of the acting, at some time during the movie, you might think, it's child porn! Seriously! From the horror movie's viewpoint, it looks like an amateur made movie! I wonder what's the world is coming to! So many awards and honors to this incredibly boring movie. Calling this a masterpiece would be an insult to even an average horror movie or a romantic movie...Whatever!!! Avoid it at all cost! You'll surely have better movies to watch than this!",sadness
"I realize the story line does not seem new. The idea has been used before. I only automatically went to see it because Owen Wilson is my favorite actor. I always go out to see his movies without even bothering to check the critic's reviews. If it weren't for Owen I would be skeptical about seeing this, I hate having my time and money wasted watching a movie I've basically seen before. This is why I feel compelled to write, I don't want you to miss out on a guaranteed funny movie that will make you laugh.The difference is in the delivery. Owen Wilson and the other VERY talented cast members make the movie a real laugh riot. When you get out and see it you will agree, each actress/actor is perfect for their part. They all play off each other with great wit. If you want an entertaining, funny movie go see You, Me and Dupree. You will not be disappointed.",sadness
"""I'm a ghost, I don't exist. I'm gonna find you and I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna disappear and no one is ever gonna know."" After stopping at a convenience store and talking to his owner friend Jeremy Coleman (Duhamel) becomes witness to a double murder. When they decide not to kill him Jeremy is left alone to ID the murderer. Not wanting loose ends Jeremy is now a target and he must now fight for his life to survive and also to take care of the killer the the cops have been trying to get for years. I will start by saying that I am a pretty big Bruce Willis fan but he has been very hit or miss lately. I really liked ""Catch .44"" but thought ""Set-Up"" was lame. Also as a disclaimer the quote I used is actually from this movie, not from the movie Taken so don't let that confuse you. The movie itself isn't anything new or amazing but it is actually pretty fast paced and keeps you interested and watching the entire time. The movie when you break it down is just another vigilante type revenge movie but again because it's so fast paced and entertaining you can't stop watching. Also Vincent D'Onofrio gives such a great performance in this that watching for just for him is almost enough to keep you till the end. Overall, this is a fast paced exciting action movie that is the perfect kind to just put in and veg out to. I liked it. I give it a B.",sadness

"Melancholia is a 2011 film written and directed by the controversial Lars Von Trier and follows two sisters as the end of the world draws near. The film is actually more about the current lives of the two sisters than it is the end of the world; yet the impending doom does heavily influence a series of events. Presently, the film has received mostly positive reviews and was praised for the imagery used throughout the film.To truly appreciate all that Melancholia has to offer the film must be analyzed by taking a look at its two separate acts. The feel of the first act is much different than the feel and plot of the second act. The first act is titled ""Justine"", as it focuses on the character Justine (Kirsten Dunst) and her severe depression on her wedding day. The first act doesn't have much to do with the fact that all life on Earth is going to be wiped out. In fact, it doesn't really focus on the impending planet collision at all; it is simply about Justine as a character and all those around her at the time of the wedding. It is clear the Justine suffers from some type of mental illness but it is not made clear exactly what is wrong with her. She does very odd things throughout her entire wedding day including cheating on her husband. She spends a majority of the time away from her party, hiding out either on the golf course located outside or with her nephew, which seems to be the only things she derives joy from. Justine can be a very annoying character to watch as she seems to want to do nothing but ruin her own party, yet the camera shots of her off on her own either on the golf course or in the backyard are some of the best in the film. The second act of the film titled ""Claire"" focuses mainly on Justine's sister Claire (Charlotte Gainsbourg), and the impending impact of the planets. The first act can be slightly more interesting because as a viewer it is not really explained why Justine is doing all of the things she does, a lot of mystery surrounds her character. The second act picks up slightly after the events of the first, but follows Claire this time. She is worried about the collision yet her husband assures her it will miss Earth and they will be able to gaze upon it with their telescope. Throughout the second act Claire must deal with her Justine's depression as well as her own husband and child, all while constantly worrying about the collision. The second half of the film is much more intense than the first, and the editing reflects that, especially towards the climax. The use of shaky shots gives the viewer a sense of uneasiness and uncertainty as to how it will end.Perhaps Melancholia's greatest achievement is its cinematography and beautiful sequence of unique shots, most notably in the opening sequence. The first opening sequence takes place entirely in slow- motion, showing many of the main characters, and is one of the highlights of the entire film. The camera work and settings used in this film are really something to talk about. The setting of a mansion is both isolating and elegant, and these two things are reflected within the carefully planned camera work.My biggest gripe with the film would definitely be its pacing. It will be really engaging one minute and then slow down to a dead halt the next. However, when the film does have its shining moments, they are extremely memorable.",sadness

I recommend you not to bother watching it as it has nothing to offer that a European does not know about the Jugoslavian war. From the perspective of romantic storyline it is also very shallow.

"First off, if really slow, atmospheric films that don't have a lot of action bore you, then this movie is NOT for you! Period. All you have to do is see the review here titled 'Snoozer, with a Stupid Ending' Point proved (well, at least if not actually 'proven', strongly suggested : ) Here is the deal; IF you are indeed going to make one of these really slow, moody films that on the surface come across as super simple, then you HAVE to do them well or forget it. The movie was beautifully photographed, VERY well paced for the material, and the acting was excellent. Do you realize how MANY frigg'n ways there are to screw something like this up? A lot! So, I honestly felt that it was put together quite nicely.Now, without spoiling anything, I just wanna say that something that I really appreciated about this film is that this 'kind' of movie (which you will understand, sort of, at the end) USUALLY is very heavy handed with the 'reveal' in the sense that they usually make it blindingly obvious. However, what I like about this one is that at the end, yes, something is strongly suggested, BUT still, things are left to be interpreted in a number of different ways (as clearly seen in some of the discussion comments below which you should absolutely NOT read before seeing the movie!) So, basically like I said, IF you like this kind of very slow, moody film where there is a very good atmosphere that builds gradually and creates a good mystery, and you don't necessarily NEED a lot of action or explanation, THEN yes, you should enjoy this movie...This film simply isn't for everyone. For example, I'm quite sure that there are MANY people who absolutely LOVE the 'SAW' or 'HOSTEL' films; quite the polar opposite of this film to be sure. So, in that case I wouldn't feel right reviewing those films because that is just NOT my type of film at all. (However, the makers of 'SAW' went on to make a couple of excellent Horror films, where people are NOT tortured or forced to do awful things, that I totally loved! ['DEAD SILENCE' & 'INSIDIOUS']) I think it is the same with this one... Likely, MOST of the people who have seen this movie and then come here and say 'Gee, that was REALLY stupid and boring' would fall into the same category: that it just isn't THEIR type of film, that's all.The movie isn't WILDLY fantastic or anything, just solidly well made; as a matter of fact, it really reminds me of another VERY similar film that I saw not long ago (I can't remember the title right off) But it was WAAAAAAAY more subtle than this one! It was similar where a woman (seemed like it was a REALLY well known actress too, perhaps Marisa Tomei, someone like that...) was staying in a remote house. And you just keep seeing this guy standing there in the room with her but she doesn't see him; there are LONG periods without ANY dialog at all. It just about ALL is based on mood and atmosphere. It was great too, but perhaps much more 'artistic' in it's approach and a bit more complex and layered in it's story than this one. This one here I would say was more directly psychological...But, there is one thing I can promise you...This movie is indeed much, MUCH better than it's current 4.x rating...",sadness

"Freaky Friday, this was such a funny movie, and a huge surprise for 2003. This is actually a new favorite comedy of mine; Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan have such a great chemistry, I was really impressed with, new comer, Lohan's performance. She and Jamie just made this film an absolute blast to watch. I think I loved Jamie more though, she captured the whole essence of being a teenager perfectly, she did not over do it at all. Not to mention she's just an absolute pleasure to watch on screen, she's such a terrific actress, I love her so much. The story was just so perfect to update into today's society where everyone is so busy to even notice each other.Anna is a teenage girl, she's pretty typical, she loves music, is a bit angry with her life, a bit of a drama queen, is annoyed by her little brother, and annoyed with her mother who is constantly on her case. Tess, Anna's mom, is a busy lady with a constant on the move schedule, she and Anna just constantly bump heads with one thing or another. Tess is also getting married again to a man who Anna is not too fond of. One night when Anna asks her mom if she can perform at a concert on the night of the wedding rehearsal, it doesn't go so well and they get into a huge fight. The restaurant owner's mom gives them a fortune cookie and ends up switching bodies. They end up learning that maybe their lives are a little harder than what they really expected it to be.Freaky Friday is a very enjoyable film that I'm very sure you'll have a good time watching. It's a very impressive comedy for any age. My favorite scene was without a doubt when Anna(in Tess's body) goes on TV discussing her latest book and tells the truth about why adults worry so much, not to mention the scene where Tess and Anna discover their bodies are switched. This is just a great remake, it has a great cast, a fun script, and is just all around a good movie, I highly recommend it.8/10",sadness
"There is a lot of negativity written and spoken about this film but actually it is not anywhere as bad as people are saying. I found the film entirely engrossing and it is definitely worth a watch, not so for the obscured and short sex scenes shown in the film between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence.I much prefer JL in 'Hunger Games' than this' it did seem to me that BL and JL were deliberately cast together to follow on from 'Silver Linings Playbook' and 'American Hustle', neither of which films i particularly enjoyed.For all the apparent failings of this film, and I agree that there are many which will deserve the movie not earning any notable Academy/Oscar nominations unless by default and design, this is for me by far the best of the JL-BC bunch.In a strange sort of way, if only wishing to portray Serena as a brave woman of some strength, I draw comparison with Danielle Steele's Zoya. Totally different kind of character and story of course.Yes the initial introduction and engagement of BC-JC in the story was suspect and I wonder how and why Serena came to be there in the first place. The 'Panther' was a feature of the film throughout and the ending of the film was not entirely surprising.There was clearly an environmental issue raised in the film which was barely explored but this was the depression-era and I guess the focus was more on the local men having a job and earning money. What would they do if logging ceased? Become tour guides for the new National Park? Unthinkable at that particular time.Toby Jones as the Sheriff gave a sold and commendable acting performance and I empathised with the Galloway character. I was half expecting some previous collection between him and Serena in the story line but it never came.All in all, there is a lot which is good about this film. Do not be over-critical and enjoy it in context.",sadness

"Very rarely can a director evoke so much awkwardness and kindness from his/her silent moments in their films. Wes Anderson is one filmmaker who can. His characters are so richly drawn, finely acted and beautifully directed, that even when they're not speaking... we can read their emotions, we feel their pain. Young Jason Swartzman gives a fantastic performance.  Even nicer is the surprise turn by Bill Murray, who manages to play a good guy and a villain at the same time. In one scene he  is wearing Budweiser boxer shorts on a diving board. He is smoking a cigarette and jumps, doing a cannonball into his sewer-ridden pool. We see him curled up at the bottom of his pool, drowning himself in misery. Is this a connection to his future lover's dead husband? Who knows. But what we do know is that Anderson has crafted his film to star the most unlikely of heroes. They are the oddest of the bunch, but at the same time we know what they are going through. Their oddness aside, what we learn to see more of, is their hearts. It is obvious Anderson has wiped his heart all over this piece, and it pays off more than I'm sure he ever could have imagined.",sadness

I was not yet tenand didn’t know what to make of so briefa bedtime story. His featureswere simple and familiar—the smile,   both eyes shut in bliss, I guessed,   head and torso echoing an antique   keyhole. From sleep’s icy edge   I asked, “How?” But he was gone,   the room all hazed. The air smelled   of struck matches, scuppernong,   a copperhead’s musk. What next?   The moon was new in the buddingbird cherry and Venus startling overhead.   Dizzy for water, I followed   my flashlight down the stairs   where the black mantel clock   was bonging. Beside it sat the twin   of my herald, a stone bookend   from Kildare and no more ableto speak or take wing than a weathercock.His closed eyes told me, “Look   inside,” but I ached to see him blaze   again and say aloud how change   could shake me to a shining. “But   I must be the key,” I thought,and stepped over the sparkling threshold.My nightshirt floated ghostlyacross the scalded lawn, under the arbor,   beside the barn, my soles not troubled   by white grass cracklingall the way to the well shed,the burning that musthave been coming from me.",sadness

"The Farrely Brothers, these are very odd film makers, they have such hits like There's Something About Mary, Dumb and Dumber and Me, Myself and Irene. I wasn't too thrilled with There's Something About Mary after all the hyped reviews, I was thinking that their other movies would be like that. Especially with the touchy subject of obesity in our world that usually big people are not attractive, making it into a comedy is tricky. But somehow I really loved Shallow Hal. Even though it was a bit hypocritical, it's still really funny and I think it's mainly due to the cast. Jack Black made for a great male lead going from a total jerk into someone that the audience absolutely adored in the end.Hal, a superficial man, and his equally shallow friend Mauricio, share an interest in beautiful women, and try to act cool and hip when around them, but most women find them obnoxious and want nothing to do with them. Hal wants to see women for their inner beauty, but his fixation on physical beauty gets in the way. By a twist of fate, Hal meets the famous American life coach Tony Robbins while stuck in an elevator. Robbins, understanding Hal's situation, hypnotizes him into seeing people's inner beauty, not their external selves. Subsequently Hal meets and is smitten by Rosemary, the daughter of his boss. Rosemary appears to him as slender and beautiful due to her kind, generous nature, but is, in actuality, morbidly obese. Rosemary, who is used to being overlooked by men due to her appearance, initially interprets Hal's interest in her as mocking and insulting, but later realizes his feelings for her are genuine. Mauricio becomes worried about Hal's new taste in women, especially when he finds Hal is in a relationship with Rosemary. One night, while Hal is on a date with Rosemary, Mauricio catches him and says the trigger phrase, ""Shallow Hal wants a gal,"" which breaks Hal's hypnosis. Now Hal has to learn on his own that the woman that he loves may not have been all that in the looks department, but is everything that he actually wants in a woman.My main problem with Shallow Hal is it's shallow message, unfortunately Hal, if he wasn't hypnotized, would have never gone for a girl like Rosemary. Even though he learns his lesson, not every shallow man or woman is going to be hypnotized into seeing what true beauty is. But there are some really great laughs that Shallow Hal provides, it's also just a heart warming romantic comedy. It's something different and the cast really made up for what could have been a disastrous movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has an open mind to a different kind of comedy with some good laughs.7/10",sadness
"Well, maybe its worth a 4 . 4,5 if I had lots to drink, got a raise and was married to a Billionaire. Honestly, this is some of the worst that has come out of the worst. The start sequence just makes you want to leave the Theater right away, burn it to the ground and never come back. Its like a cheap TV show with bad lines and people who cant take a ""punch"". The best way to describe it is ""Hercules meets Robin Hood"" and had it been a TV show, lots would have been forgiven because most TV shows seldom has the budget or the actors to do make historical drama's stand out. But if you really want to make a ""follow up"" on an eternal historic movie like the original 1959 Ben-Hur, you better make it count, but this fails on all levels. Its just terrible and Im sure that Charlton Heston is turning in his grave. May Director Timur Bekmambetov be ashamed of himself",sadness
"I saw this movie on a girls-night-out to the movies, and we chose it on the basis of the previews, which had billed it as a romantic comedy. Wow, were they ever wrong! The basic plot is this: Woman loses husband far too early and tragically. Woman grieves for husband, hard. Husband, through a plan pre-arranged before his death, sends woman letters at set intervals, each one causing a fresh stream of tears to fall.The acting was great. Hillary Swank was particularly good in her role, and let us see her vulnerability and conflicting emotions. The supporting cast was all excellent, and ladies, there is more than enough male eye candy in this movie to go around.But - and I strongly warn all of you considering this as a light comedy or a date movie - it's sad. Very very sad. Even the happy parts are sad. If you go see this, wear waterproof mascara and bring lots of tissues. Don't say I didn't warn you.",sadness

"I'm not gonna write out the storyline like other reviews have on this page just to save time. Personally i think some of the reviews on this page are very unfair. It's a raunchy teen comedy, What do you want? it's not directed by the Cohen brothers. This film is no better or worse than any teen comedy before it. To be honest i liked the fact it's a different slant on teen comedy and it's a fresh style steering away from the 'Bro! you cannot graduate a virgin!' teen movies (which basically is what every American Pie spin off was. This film had some good laughs and had a pretty solid comedy storyline: 3 guys town full of hot older women looking for sex. How can the storyline be confusing?I would definitely tell my friends about this movie and it's nice to see some fresh faces on the teen comedy circuit instead of Sean William- Scott in everything. Not a classic but good for a laugh! i give this movie 7/10",sadness

"Romantic comedies have changed a bit since their late nineties/early two thousands heyday. Gone are the days of Julia Roberts being, ""just a girl, in front of a boy, asking him to love her."" It seems somewhere around 2005, Hollywood finally got the message and decided unrealistic, overly romantic gestures like stopping the girl at the airport, or stopping her from marrying the wrong guy at the altar was just a tad too much. Thus we get something like The Perfect Match, a movie sans the final act clichés but still clinging to old attitudes about men and women.Charlie (Jenkins) is just not the dating type. Living large as a successful music agent and budding photographer, Charlie spends his days meeting up with, and quickly discarding a bevy of attractive women. His friends; a regular cabal of walking stock-characters, tell him he should settle down lest he spend his life alone. Then he meets Karen (Hawk) a women who wants to escape from the long-term relationship feedback loop. ""I just want something without any attachments,"" she says to Charlie as the two get to know each other. Thus what starts as a simple arrangement between two young, attractive people, turns into something more complicated.Despite some welcomed changes to the genre, The Perfect Match is beat by beat, very beholden to a comedic style that hasn't been in vogue since the nineties. Charlie and his friends Victor (Riley) and Rick (Faison) joke around about how unreasonable, shrewish and/or costly their women are while falling into sitcom dad situations that could easily be avoided if they communicated better. Charlie's sister Sherry (Patton) takes no time explaining to the audience that she's a therapist and delves into Charlie's inner thoughts before we even have the time to get to know him. The first act is so paint by numbers that there's actually something kind of appealing to the menagerie of dated gender role jokes. It's like peering into the psyche of a Bill Burr fan or the Facebook feed of a college sophomore; it's all ""women be like _______"" jokes.The characterizations vary not just actor to actor but scene to scene. One minute Robert Christopher Riley's character is noticeably panicked about the cost of his wedding to his fiancée Ginger (London). The next moment he's completely zen without much resolution. Cassie Ventura leans into the testy Latina stereotype which surprisingly is the most consistent and interesting supporting character in the film. Faison brings much needed levity whenever he's on screen but he, along with everyone else is still just reading their lines, collecting a paycheck and going home.The exact same thing can be said about the main romance, which lacks everything but the bare cliché. Largely established with a coiling array of lovemaking scenes set to R&B music, Jenkins and Hawk seem completely at odds with each other. The chemistry was wholly absent and provides no warmth the audience can cling to. When our smitten hero comes face to face with the perfunctory third act romantic misunderstanding, his reaction is complete overkill, given the fact that he barely knows Karen.In-spite of all it's various faults, I cannot deny this movie will be exactly what many are looking for. It's a de-fanged romantic comedy with a salient moral about not being a scrub. It provides some fun eye-candy for both sexes and it wasn't directed terribly. In-fact I would argue this kind of material is beneath director Bille Woodruff who has a way with composition and ensemble blocking. It's not love & Basketball (2000), heck it's not even Think Like a Man (2012) but at least it's heart is in the right place.",sadness

"""A newlywed couple finds their lake-country honeymoon descend into chaos after Paul finds Bea wandering and disoriented in the middle of their first night.""That's really all you need to know. Reading too much about this movie will give too much. Trailer actually gives away too much. Excellent storytelling makes this ""same old"" story refreshing. Movie will keep playing with audiences, making them guess which horror subgenre will it go as the movie closes in? Is it good old ""there's evil in the woods!"" story? Is it a vampire movie? Is it something entirely else?Good atmosphere, good use of sets and locations. Good acting by Rose Leslie and Harry Treadaway make somewhat B script seem much more larger and better then it actually is. It's moves slow at time which only adds to atmosphere and character build. Speaking of characters it's refreshing to see likable characters that you don't want to die immediately after they are introduced into the movie. It only adds up to horror when terror finally starts. Screenplay itself gives you just enough to know what's going on (mostly at the end), but thankfully nothing was overexplained and too detailed. It's refreshing actually, and something new for younger audiences. They'll actually have to use bit of their imagination at last!Two especially nasty scene. No jump scares (thank God!), but uneasy mood along with good score makes this movie rather creepy.Must be my lucky dice, I've seen two movies in two days that are less on special effects and atmosphere\storytelling heavy.",sadness

But the maniac is all too real and the woman is plunged into a nightmare which there may be no escape from.My Thoughts: Steve Sessions takes a micro-budget stab at the whole ""torture-porn"" phenomenon started by Eli Roth's ""Hostel"". While certainly not a brutal as that film, ""Torment"" actually doesn't focus primarily on grossing the audience out. Don't get me wrong, there are pretty gruesome tongue ripping and hand dismemberment scenes, the story is pretty much standard slasher material.The performances from the cast are convincing, the pacing is pretty tight, and the special effects are very good.Final Thoughts: Rent it whenever it comes out. Slasher and micro-budget horror fans will not be disappointed.",sadness

After reading the numerous negative comments, I was pretty skeptical and didn't really make an effort to get to the TV in time for it starting. What a mistake that was. My word, this was one funny film! Perhaps it's an acquired sense of humour, but in some parts I was laughing so hard my stomach hurt! It's certainly not a film that requires thought or is deep and meaningful in any way, but if you want a giggle, then Nine Months will definitely put a smile on your face. It did mine! The only downside is perhaps having such high profile stars in not very challenging roles. Aside from this, Nine Months is a light hearted comedy that really got me laughing.",sadness
"A MacGuffin is an object that the characters value and that drives the plot, but the specific nature of the object is not important. In some movies, the nature of the MacGuffin is never explained to the audience. In thrillers, that can work.

No back story, no motivations, no personality, nothing.The fact that a cardboard cutout could alter the courses of their lives made me lose interest in the characters of the three brothers, and when Susanna was finally removed from the story line, I was still wondering whether the audience was supposed to care.20% visual delight; 80% irritating script.",sadness

The chemistry between these two is undenyingly the strongest point of this film. I've seen Rose Leslie in GoT and she proved her worth in that series as well as this film. I can foresee a very successful career for her and will be keeping an eye on her future works. I was unfamiliar with Harry Treadway but I will be definitely watching him in the years to come. There are elements of classic horror from the 70s and 80s which I found to be highly effective. I highly recommend this film, for it will sit with you for days to come.",sadness
"It's a low budget horror movie, but not cheesy in the least. There is no cheesy fake blood and gore, no sex crazed teenagers, and no topples bubble headed blond's running from a psycho killer.No cheap thrills here, just a very complex and layered plot with plenty of twist and turns. The movie never once lost my attention nor did I ever get lost in the plot. The movie moved slow enough to build likable characters and to build up suspense, but also wasn't so slow that it lost my interest.I loved watching Annie as she went through the motions of loss and anger and then fear, and then ultimately the courage to discover clues and dig up old family secrets.",sadness
"Maybe it was the great, eclectic soundtrack with the likes of Django Reinhardt, Herbie Hancock, Perry Como, Curtis Mayfield, Neil Young and Richie Havens, or maybe it was the dark and subtle bits of humor that pleasantly surprised me throughout the movie, but I really enjoyed this one.We meet Tom, a forlorn twenty-something man-child still living at home and struggling to take control of his life, played by David Schwimmer of ""Friends"" fame. Tom gets a call from a woman who mistakenly believes he knew her recently deceased son. He goes along with it, presumably to save her the added grief of knowing her son had no close friends. Of course, Tom's accommodating nature backfires and he's asked to give the eulogy for a man he never knew. This sets up a scene with the kind of dark humor seen throughout the movie that audiences are either delighted with or immediately turned off by.At the funeral, Tom meets Julie, his unrequited high school crush, played with genuine emotion and winsome grace by Gwyneth Paltrow. Thus begins two relationships that play out over the duration of the film --one with Grace, the bereft mother of the friend Tom never had, played by Barbara Hershey, and the other with Julie.Yes, this movie owes much, in terms of plot and characters, to ""The Graduate,"" with Hershey playing the counterpart to Anne Bancroft's Mrs. Robinson. But it turns out to be much more than just an update of the '60s classic. The audience really gets to know the inner turmoil both Tom and Julie are going through -- Tom, both for the guilt of becoming unwittingly involved with Grace, and for also being involved with Julie at the same time, and Julie, for being torn between striking out on her own to escape her overbearing parents and getting into a deep relationship with Tom.There are a couple of sideplots going on with Tom's friends -- Michael Rapaport's character getting married to a woman his friends don't like, and Michael Vardan's married character, making a move on Julie, which obviously infuriates Tom. And Carol Kane as Tom's mom, is precious. In one scene, he is livid after she bursts into his room unannounced. After she receives a brief scolding for not knocking, she replies ""I only wanted to see if you wanted some ice cream,"" to which he replies ""A little."" Schwimmer nails the role, with his underplayed, tacit sadness about his so-far-failed attempt at making a responsible life for himself. And Paltrow, well, can she ever miss? Whether for the dark humor, spot-on acting, or superb soundtrack, this one is definitely worth a viewing.",sadness

"First off--this is well worth seeing, it is consistently funny--and at times keel-over funny. However if you're looking for a meaningful plot that gets neatly wrapped up, that's not gonna happen. Like porn, the plot was just there as an excuse for the many 'money shots'--the consistently funny gags about typical 40ish couple's lives.Rudd's character is suffering a struggling business (and also maybe a little of 'struggling business'--if you know what I mean). Mann's character has a business also, that is suffering. Their kids are dealing with various modern-kid issues--Facebook bullies, trying to devour entire seasons of ""Lost"" in a matter of days, etc. The parents fight, the kids fight, Rudd & Mann each have issues with their own parents--one with abandonment issues, the other with what might be the polar opposite of abandonment.And the gags and issues that arise, I can tell you, are all based in reality--it's a good composite of the issues that this demographic actually faces--only depicted with the cinematic equivalent of the ""Photoshop saturation slider"" cranked to 11. A special mention for Leslie Mann and Judd Apatow's kids--they actually can act, and they were excellent in this film. They belonged in the film--not 'becuase their daddy is the producer'--but because they added big-time in both the many comedy scenes they were in, but also in the movie's scattered drama moments. Very adorable kids, who blended into this movie effortlessly and definitely added to its charm.So that's the plot, and in the end, it leaves you with hope that things will get better, but never really pounds that point down and gift-wraps a sappy, happy ending, but it doesn't need to--the plot is just a vehicle to tow all of the gags with.And the gags, mini-skits, etc, are very funny, and very consistent--me, my wife, and most of the theater were laughing through the bulk of the film (Stay for the ending credits--the blooper reel with Melissa McCarthy may be one of the funniest of the entire movie).So that's it--I give it a 8--well worth seeing in the theater, and when it comes out on DVD, I'll definitely rent it and see it again.",sadness
"I downloaded & watched this because it had Keith David in it & it looked like it was an African-American horror film. Yes. Both correct, but both tragically bad attempts.Keith...wtf And you co-produced this? Man, what were you thinking. Snorefest. Poor character development, pathetic continuity, molasses styled pacing. It takes over 20mins before someone even bothers to pick up a script.And seriously, could they not even afford a second camera. Watch carefully, no don't even carefully watch, just look at the screen & see glaringly the lack of 'cinematography'. The one camera & badly placed one at that, screams at the viewer for attention. Boring...Okay, granted that the snow bound Minnesota setting was not a clichéd location for the cast & they tried to give some historical slant to the proceedings. But major fail on all accounts. It had no real bearing on the ..er plot.And did they have to stereotype them, despite them being uppity black folk, by having them smoke weed. C'mon. Was that to give them cred for the potential audience despite them all being rich greedy w@nkers.And the white couple. what was the point of them & especially their only lines of dialogue at the beginning that just happened to imply racist attitudes.

As we follow the developing story there are some odd events making the viewer wonder if this is science fiction or not.

I was not bored at any point, and indeed intrigued. I wondered whether I was going to be let down by the story, but actually the ending was far more interesting than I imagined.

"Most of us dream about the future. ""What will they think of next?"", we wonder as we marvel at the technological innovations of the present and try to imagine what could be on the other side of the horizon. We're curious to see how society will change with the times as we reflect back on everything we've seen already. We want the best for our children and we hope to live long enough to see them reach their goals and find happiness. Most of us wish for a long and healthy life, and would consider that a tremendous blessing. But can there really be too much of a good thing? Is it possible that longevity could, at some point, become a curse? In ""The Age of Adaline"" (PG-13, 1:50), one woman finds out that joy and pain can both increase with time.""Adaline Bowman lived a normal life,"" the film's narrator tells us. Adaline (Blake Lively) grows up, marries and has a child. When Adaline's daughter, Flemming, is an old woman (and is played by Ellen Burstyn), Adaline looks like she's still in her late 20s. But that's only because she is. On an unusually cold California night, the young mother's car slid off a country road and into a stream. The combination of the frigid water and a lightning strike had a unique effect on Adaline's body. She stopped aging.A condition that some would kill for creates a very unusual problem for Adaline. An acquaintance who hasn't seen her in years expresses shock when she remarks that Adaline hasn't changed a bit. A cop who pulls Adaline over for speeding becomes suspicious of the age on her driver's license. When the attention that is attracted by her unchanging looks starts to become threatening, Adaline feels that she has no choice but to run.Eventually, she decides that she even has to start living separately from her then high school-aged daughter. The two maintain their relationship over the years with phone calls and they occasionally meet, but that is the only close relationship that Adaline allows herself. When she realizes that someone is becoming too big a part of her life, she pulls back. Everyone must be kept at arm's length. And every ten years or so, Adaline establishes a new identity and moves to a new location. No one can ever know her secret. It's better this way, she tells herself.Flemming wishes her mother could find happiness, and Adaline is tired of running, but it's all she knows and then she meets Ellis Jones (Michiel Huisman). He's young, handsome, charming, wealthy and very interested in Adaline. He senses that she's special, although he has no idea just how special. She tries to resist his attempts at starting a relationship, but (in case I didn't mention it already), he's young, handsome, charming, wealthy and very interested in Adaline. And Adaline is indeed lonely. She hesitates, but accepts his invitation to spend a weekend with his parents (Harrison Ford and Kathy Baker) to help celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary. On that trip, she encounters someone who knew her many years before. Adaline does her best to explain it all away, but her secret life is dangerously close to unraveling, just as her relationship with Ellis is getting more serious.""The Age of Adaline"" is wonderfully original and well-executed. The plot begs comparison to the 2008 Brad Pitt movie ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"", but this film is much smarter and more touching. This script does a good job of making what is basically a fantasy film scenario seem almost plausible, but that's beside the point. The story is so involving that it really doesn't matter how Adaline ended up in her predicament. Lively plays her as a beautiful young woman with an old soul. It's a very effective and sympathetic portrayal. We feel Adaline's heartache; we admire her intelligence, determination and resourcefulness and we wish right along with her daughter that Adaline could just be happy. The script also resists the temptation of putting too many verbal winks to Adaline's condition into the dialog. The story is very grounded for a fantasy and the plot unfolds organically, without pretense or any more artifice than is necessary for the film's premise. Most importantly, in Adaline's struggles, we see reflected the power and the many facets of love.As much as I happen to love this movie, I have to remain objective enough to point out what I saw as some minor flaws in its execution. The narration, while helping the audience understand what is happening to this woman, sometimes gets a little too wordy for its own good. The method used to fill us in about Adaline's backstory is creative, but not very well edited. Lastly, Huisman's acting is serviceable, but is a bit of a weak link in an otherwise strong chain of performances. But at the end of the day, these really are minor criticisms of what I consider to be one of the best movies I have seen this year. ""The Age of Adaline"" is basically a well written, terrifically acted, beautifully shot movie that tells a fascinating and original story that will tickle your brain and touch your heart. What (or maybe I should ask ""when"") IS the Age of Adaline? It is now. Go see this movie, before you get another day older. ""A""",sadness

"Henry Thomas plays a soul dead guy who's senses are very high. He works in a place where they make artificial flavors for food and he has a keen sense of taste and smell. But his life is empty.

And he falls in love with her because he feels her from the inside. So he sets out to find her.Mick Garris' movies are considered horror movies, but if you really watch them there is more than blood, guts and gore.

"This film is 100% spectacular, in my opinion. As we all know from the previews prior to the release, Johnny Depp's character must choose between his living and dead brides, essentially. To be perfectly honest, throughout most of the film, I was undecided on who I thought he'd choose and be able to work it out with. This is accounted for by wonderful story-fying and lovely screen writing! Danny Elfman is the musical genius still, not that I had any doubts.Overall, throughout my viewing of the film, I was in awe, gales of laughter, near tears, or just plain excited! Tim Burton has done it again.AMAZING FILM!",sadness
"This film is not recommended. Movies have always dealt authors suffering from writers' block and the desperate acts that lead them on the path of destruction. Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard and The Lost Weekend, the Coen Brothers' Barton Fink, Spike Jonze's Adaptation, and the granddaddy of all writers' block movies, The Shining, are prime examples of this theme. ( We can also add to that distinguished list: Deathtrap, Misery, Wonder Boys, and Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry. ) That empty page can send anyone reeling! The heavy price of fame and blind ambition!Now we have the drama, The Words, of which I am not at a loss at finding. Yes, I have plenty to say about this noble and unsatisfying effort that never really clicks. The film preaches that there is a fine line between life and fiction and the choices to be made, but the filmmakers never commit to make that clear choice and their final product blurs that fine line between concise storytelling and logical sense. Its story-within-a-story-within-a-story-within-a- story approach remains confusing and ambiguous at best.Story One has successful novelist, Clay Hammond ( Dennis Quaid ), reading his best-seller to a devoted following. Aptly titled The Words, which may be autobiographical or a work of fiction, Hammond meets a mysterious fan, Daniella (Olivia Wilde ) there. This leads to...Story Two, the main story, which shows an author's solitary life is not a romantic one, unless you're handsome Bradley Cooper who plays Rory, a writer who has difficulty with his next novel now. With the blank page staring back at him, he has not found any words, be they right or wrong, to create that next novel. The words somehow elude him. That is until one day when his loving wife ( Zoe Saldana ) buys him an antique briefcase which happens to contain a lost manuscript by another nameless writer, henceforth named the Old Man ( Jeremy Irons ). This, of course, leads our conflicted Rory to a moral and ethical crossroads and takes us to...Story Three, in which a young WWII soldier falls for a French woman, played by Ben Barnes and Nora Arnezeder, who love and suffer as beautifully as they look. And suffer do we all in this predictable and conflicted romantic tale, as The Words tries to connect its various subplots about the past and present events with varying degrees of success. Newcomers Brian Klugman and Lee Sternthal solidly directed the film, but it is their work as the film's screenwriters where they lose their direction. The filmmakers essentially try to converge three separate tales into one multi-layered story, but the stories never become a cohesive whole. This writing team should have done some further editing and revisions, blocking their tendency to complicate their film with multiple narrative structuring. Perhaps if they would have focused and expanded on one central storyline, the film would have been more interesting and fulfilling. As it is, the multi-story arcs never bridge the gap and the moviegoer is left wondering about all the fuss. Most of the actors deliver their lines with effective precision and add greater depth with their loosely written roles. Cooper, Saldana, and Barnes achieve credibility and have some strong moments, and Irons, with his acting formidable talents, brings a hint of tragedy and pathos that is missing from this sketchiest of character. His is a wonderful supporting performance in a film that needs all the support it can get.Ironically, it's the written words from an ill-conceived script that cannot rectify and resolve the multiple story lines in The Words. Its cumbersome interweaving of its trio of stories just becomes a tangled melodramatic mess, ultimately leaving The Words rather tongue-tied.

"I guess that sums it up good. Hopefully you don't have bad feelings towards the actors involved (especially Mandy Moore), because you wouldn't be able to like or enjoy the movie otherwise. But Martin Freeman and Moore do have a special chemistry and it works for the purpose of the movie. It's not that you will be cheering at the screen (I'm assuming here), but you will like them.If that is not enough, maybe the decent comedy in place will please you. The theme is an adult one, which although there is not that much going on (explicit wise), the movie is rated R in America. In Germany and other European countries this probably looks different, because it is tame by their standards. A heads up to what you may expect.",sadness

"The Vow is a wonderful little movie. At first blush, the movie seemed like it's another 50 First Dates, but without the comedy. The only similarity to 50 First Dates is that both the female leads suffer from amnesia with their respective significant others trying to win her heart. The Vow actually comes across having a feel more like The Notebook.It's the story of the romance between Leo (Channing Tatum) and Paige (Rachel McAdams), and who are victims of a car accident. Leo recovers, but Paige emerges with no memories of her whole relationship nor marriage to Leo, and he must now make her fall in love with him again. In her mind, as Leo says in one of the trailers for this movie, she's still engaged to her ex-fiancé.The movie manages to avoid cheap Hollywood writing, and gently leads you down its plot. Just when you think you might know where the story is going, it heads in a different direction. Details are revealed to you layer by layer as Paige discovers them. Tatum's voice-over was somewhat annoying, and unnecessary.In trying to remember her memories, Paige manages to gain a new life. Opening in time for Valentine's Day, this makes for a wonderful date-night movie.",sadness

There are two kinds of bad movies, one where everything is so bad that they are not trying to hide it, and second when it is bad and they are trying to be serious at it makes it 10 times more worse! I am not speaking about actors or quality of movie, I am speaking about scenario! Seriously who has written the scenario? Even me who have seen only a few C.S.I. TV show series can tell that this movie is really badly made, police looks like monkeys who has no idea what they are doing nor what to do.

"Normally love dramas don't interest me, since I find them boring and predictable. This film, while being more than ""just"" a good love drama, really impressed me. Many of the scenes are quite visually beautiful, some in cinematography, others in content. As a love drama, it's moving, and at times almost poetically beautiful. It involves three men, brothers, who are all in love with the same woman. She has a relationship with each of them, but ultimately realizes that she only loves one of them. The plot is very good, and evolves at the right pace for this type of story. Not terribly fast, but never stands still either. The actors all portray their respective characters well, nearly all of them giving a perfect performance. Anthony Hopkins is great, as always. There was not really anything in this movie that disappointed me. The ending scene involves some of the best cinematography I've ever seen. There is a very emotional scene near the end which is also one of the most visually beautiful I've ever seen in a movie. I recommend this to most fans of love dramas, and, to a lesser extent, fans of war dramas. 8/10",sadness

"Dev D is a modern-day interpretation of the classic novel ""Devdas"" by Sarat Chandra. Dev (Abhay Deol), Paro (Mahi Gill) and Chanda (Kalki Koechlin) of Dev D reflect the sensibilities, conflicts aggression, and independence. Free thought, exuberance and recklessness of the youth of today. A generation that is jammed between eastern roots and western sensibilities. Dev D is set in the rustic and colorful Punjab and also explores the dingy, morbid, dark underbelly of Delhi. From sprawling mustard fields to a riot of neon. Now we have come through various versions of the novel ""Devdas"", but ""Dev. D"" is way different than all the others. It's not actually the remake of Devdas, yet it can be said as it has been just inspired by it. There are minor similarities yet the characters are similar in a way. The new Devdas likes to have his vodka with Coke, asks Paro for some nude pictures of herself, chats with Paro through IM, likes to have sex, smokes even during pissing after waking up in the morning & does other various stuffs according to the current trend of Indian Youth. There are so many reasons why ""Dev. D"" strikes hard on it's viewers. It's a coming of an age cinema of Bollywood. Bollywood never did witnessed any stuff like Dev. D ever before. The soul of the movie lies within it's characters, specially ""Dev.D"" along with Paro, Chanda & Chunni. The movie also depicts Delhi in a superior way. Anurag Kashyap always trying to do something new & creative with each of his movies. First it was Black Friday, which portrayed some stunning reality behind the blasts in Mumbai in the year 1993, which also made it highly controversial & then it was ""No Smoking"", which was an attempt of a cult movie, though it failed to express the real message behind the movie. Anurag Kashyap this time does it in a Tarantino style. A love story in a Tarantino way. Now that's something really innovative! He gives an extra-ordinary direction, with keeping in mind to entertain the viewers. The humor of the movie with it's witty one liners keeps the viewers hooked during the first half. Though the second half looses it's momentum a bit, the movie still strikes in a powerful way. Now if we talk about the performances, Abhay Deol is one of the most talented actors in Bollywood. Not only he performs well, but what he did in this movie is called ""Class Act"". Top class act by Abhay. Also the performances by the two of the new-comers is refreshing & amazing. Adding to all the factors above is the music or the score of the movie. That's something different yet again for Bollywood. The track ""Emotional Atyachar"" is already famous. But the best tracks of the movie are ""Ek Hulchul Si"" & ""Emotional Atyachar (Rock Version)"". It would simply blow the mind of the lovers of rock music. Excellent songs & score by Amit Trivedi. The unusual cinematography of the movie gives the movie a different look, yet a dark look. Dev.D is a fantastic movie to be made in Bollywood history. A never before experienced love story with sex, drugs, drinks & lot many stuffs. A classic love story with fantastic performance by Abhay Deol.",sadness

"The Story Of Us is a wonderful movie in its own subtle way. I won't go into specifics about the plot, as many others before me have already done that. All I will say is that it's probably not for the younger crowd. In all honesty, if I had seen this film in my early twenties (and I'm now almost 40), I wouldn't have appreciated its subtlety on long term relationships. It's aimed at those of us who have been married, or in a long term relationship. Although I don't have children, the rest of this movie had many ""oh yeah"" moments for me. The Story of Us, is a complex, yet ultimately simple, explanation of long term relationships...all those 'little' things about the other person that drive you insane about them, but that if you're both willing to work on, make the relationship all that much richer for it. Wonderfully thought provoking. If you have ever been in a long term adult relationship, I'd be hard pressed to see how you COULDN'T relate, at the very least, on some small level to this film.",sadness

"Have you heard of Stay? If you're here you must have but I'll bet it wasn't too long ago that you found out about it. It's a movie that came out late last year with little fanfare, was dismissed as a poor movie by critics and quickly ushered back out of theaters.It's a crying shame.It was a wonderful movie. My favorite type of movies are psychological horror movies. Favorites include: Jacob's Ladder, Mulholland Dr., Donnie Darko, and in a similar realm, Momento and Fight Club. I love seeing a good representation of the human mind on film and that is exactly what this film shows so well.It's about a college student (Ryan Gosling) who tells his shrink (Ewan McGregor) that he is going to kill himself on the stroke of midnight this Saturday, leaving his shrink to enlist the help of his formerly suicidal girlfriend (Naomi Watts) to figure out why he wants to kill himself and how to stop him, while his world falls apart.It's directed by Marc Forster of Monster's Ball and Finding Neverland fame. The movie has been called pretentious, shallow, ridiculous, bewildering, absurd, and empty by many reviewers. Personally I think that they didn't have the patience for it and/or were put off by its extravagant visuals and cuts. I thought it was great and deserves much more credit than it has received.The movie's visual style is very interesting and jarring in a good way. It had me constantly saying to my girlfriend ""did you see that?"" Full of slight of the hand camera/editing tricks. Nearly everything in the movie is symbolic of other things or ideas in the movie. The acting is very good, especially among the lesser characters. Everything in the movie feels so unreal, but that is serves some purpose even if one couldn't know what it is right away. A second viewing would reveal many new things. In the end much of the movie is left up to interpretation and my girlfriend and I had a good conversation about our ideas on what things meant in the movie. After thinking about it for a day I'm pretty sure that I could explain everything in the movie, even what the hell is up with Ewan McGregor's pants, Why Gosling wanted to commit suicide and the twins and triplets.It was fun was figuring out what the rest of the movie meant after seeing its end, the solution. The movie is like a code and the end is the decryption key. It differs from other ""sixth sense"" type surprise ending movies because everything you would see in the movie before the end would not act as a clue to what it all means or what the ending is. It's more like decrypting a diary than a problem with a solution to it.Basically, any movie buff owes it to themselves to see this movie. I rented it but after seeing it I fully intend to purchase the DVD.",sadness
"I did enjoy the film. However, Gerard Depardieu's character is an anthropologist whose main focus of study are the Maori of Aotearoa/New Zealand. Being from New Zealand, I have grown up with Maori culture. So it affected my appreciation of the film when the character shows a Maori tattoo which is blue. BLUE?!?! Blue is NOT the colour of a Maori Tattoo! And there is a scene where the character recreates a haka - - but in an extremely incorrect way. A Maori haka is a dance or war; it is meant to show strength, empower your warriors and scare the opposition. One doesn't run from side to side slapping oneself for no reason and throwing ones arms in the air like a monkey. It is offensive. Gah! Who did their research?! Bimboland does tell a good story. But please do some effective research, lest you alienate your international audience.",sadness

"Firstly, before I review Derailed I'd like to put this message or rather pose this question of action fans. How is it possible that you guys can sit down and critique an action movie on its cheesiness and cinematic shortcomings? It's an action movie, that's typical of the genre and isn't worth mentioning to the rest of us. I think anybody would have to be out of their mind to grade action movies along the same lines as serious, dramatic Oscar-TYPE movies. Shame on you, my friends and I totally get off on the very failings you point out. The cheesier the better. Now the review...Derailed undoubtedly struck me from the first as being yet another UNDER SIEGE 2 ripoff. But trust me, Van Damme hardly has his choice of tremendous scripts since becoming obscured in the memory of Hollywood. The action is predictable to anyone familiar to the genre, however hardcore Van Damme fans will get off on at least a couple hilarious moments like throwing one of the hostage-takers 15 feet with one arm headfirst into a door and then throwing him off the train with one arm. And the totally low-budget train-roof scene where one hostage-taker goes flying after a car explosion into one of the fakest backgrounds I've seen. Plus, you can't forget the night to day same scene transition! All in all, if you like the man, it's money well spent!",sadness

"I saw an advanced screening, and I cannot tell you the last time I had so much fun at a movie. I knew as soon as the critics started saying they hated it, that it was the movie for me. If you grew up with the hair bands and take this for the campy make fun of the 80's lead singer movie that this is, I have no doubt you will see the brilliance. (keep in mind this was a stage show long before Glee ever came out) The boy/girl story is weak and has been told a million times, but the rest of it is awesome. It feels like Cruise channeled Jim Morrison and Axl Rose to perfection (and Im not really even a Cruise fan). The combination of Brand/Baldwin is hilarious. This movie is not meant to be the same caliber as My Fair Lady or The Sound of Music, so don't go looking for edge of your seat drama/action, go for the pure fun and enjoyment have having fun at a movie. Its the kind of movie you need to see multiple times to catch everything, and even though I got to see it for free, you can bet I will be a paying customer when it releases this weekend.",sadness
"An incestuous mother and son (Krige, Krause) of preternatural origin move to a small town to find a young female virgin (Amick) the son may take the life force of and feed the mother with. It's Stephen King, who wrote the screenplay, at his not bad best. Interesting music; I've never heard Enya in a horror movie before but surprisingly it works. As with Ron Perlman, I'd pretty much sit through anything with Alice Krige in it. The down side is that although the mother and son are interesting beings the curiosity about them the movie arouses is not satisfied. What are they? A kind of feline lineage is hinted at as they can morph into variations of cat like creatures yet cats are their mortal enemies (a scratch can be fatal). Where are they from? Egypt is hinted at (the origin of the worship of Bast, perhaps). Why are they called Sleepwalkers (origins of the incubus/succubus/vampire mythologies)? Despite the questions raised and unanswered the film is still an enjoyable gore-fest horror break from reality. Worth a rent/buy used, especially for fans of Stephen King's work.",sadness

"Not having read past the first chapter of the book I was happy to judge this film entirely on its own merits rather than comparing it with the well-known novel. Almost, anyway - the first chapter I remember was hilarious - yet the momentum is sadly lacking in the opening scene which dismisses the humour within seconds. World War II approaches and Germany and Mussolini invade Greece. Nicolas Cage, as the unconvincing Italian captain who is more attuned to singing than warfare, demonstrates quite admirably that this is the sort of film he should leave well alone. Penelope Cruz, as the Greek girl betrothed to another but who falls in love with Cage is slightly better, but not enough to lift this bland and syrupy film above mediocrity. The rest of acting is fairly wooden, most of the script quite predictable, and the moral ambiguities of fighting for the 'right' side barely touched. The ending is unsatisfactory,as if we are expected to wait a couple of years and part with more money for part two. Part one didn't hold enough promise - the tedium and self-adoration in the photography and music failed to justify a film of over two hours that could have risen (but fell) on its own merits and lack of them, but it will most surely disappoint the many fans of what is reputedly an excellent novel.",sadness

"By far, 'Something Borrowed' is not an Oscar worthy masterpiece. But as far as chick flicks are concerned, this one was very enjoyable. Unlike many movies I've seen with a similar storyline, this one focuses not only on the present but also on the past. In fact, if you're able to see past the shallow plot, you'll find that there are some actual thought provoking ideas behind 'Something Borrowed'. The movie deals with choosing between what's morally right and what's right for one's happiness. Various characters seem to dwell on the past, and it therefore also addresses people's inability to forgive themselves for past mistakes. Personally, I could really relate to some the issues the character's faced, such as Ginnifer Goodwin's regret over making the wrong choices which therefore altered her life. The movie often veers from being a typical Chick Flick to a Drama, and some scenes brought a little tear to my eye. The acting was excellent, the actors performances very convincing, and some scenes (such as flashbacks) were very well directed. Admittedly, there was some back and forth within the story, and some scenes were added purely for reaction- but overall, this, to me, was a great flick for a rainy Saturday afternoon.",sadness

ANY parent, single or not can relate to a lot of the situations that arise.The comedy is just right, without being slapstick or over the top. The touching moments come sometimes when you least expect them, and while sure to bring a tear, the movie doesn't milk the drama. The scenery is gorgeous. The one-liners and timing are perfect. For me, the film never dragged, and while it has an optimistic ending, everything isn't all sewn up in a happily-ever-after-scenario. We know that, if these were real families, there would be more bumps in the road, more laughs and more lessons to be learned.This is a good family movie--not much to cover your kids' ears over--and a great movie for anyone who has been a parent, and especially anyone who has tried to enter the dating/new relationship stage after the death or divorce of a spouse.Go see it!!",sadness

"If you tell someone there's a new show that is similar to ""Castle"" and ""Elementary""--with a man-woman team that solves murders--he might say he wants to check it out, because he likes both of those shows. Or he might say it's been done before and refuse to watch it.The new show ""Forever"" involves a homicide detective, Jo Martinez (Alana De La Garza), and a medical examiner, Dr. Henry Morgan (Ioan Gruffudd), who work together to solve murders. Like Sherlock in ""Elementary"", Henry utilizes amazing powers of observation to deduce the truth. Will Henry and Jo become romantically involved, like Castle and Beckett? It seems destined to be.Unlike Sherlock, Henry is very attached to a family member--Abe, played by Judd Hirsch, who is Henry's adopted ""son"". And there's another important twist: Doc Henry is immortal. He has lived for about two hundred years and he considers that a curse. He has chosen to eschew close relationships, knowing the inevitable pain of loss that must result when he outlives a loved one.The appeal of the show depends upon the three main characters. Fortunately these three actors are fun to watch and bring believability to a supernatural premise.After watching the first two episodes, it seems that the writing will bring interesting stories to the murder-solving genre. I want to see how many ways they can use Henry's ""affliction"" to advance a plot. In the pilot, Henry uses himself as a guinea pig to test the properties of a deadly poison--something that even Sherlock cannot do.The story takes place in New York City, so put on your thinking cap and watch ""Forever"" over a cocktail--perhaps a Manhattan.Update 10/8/14: After watching the episode titled ""The Art of Murder"", I am finding this new show even more enjoyable. This episode draws on Henry's personal experiences to create a truly emotional resolution, which might have been aided by the music of Ella Fitzgerald. I may have to increase my rating if this keeps up.",sadness

"I wanted to love this movie, but from the ill-conceived Sondre Lerche soundtrack to the beating down of the intellectual, I left the movie ticked off. Juliette Binoche is lovely, Emily Blunt has a really funny scene and Steve Carrell is good as always. But overall, I was disappointed and hated most of the other characters. I wanted all the daughters to be given up for adoption and Dane Cook should not be allowed to act in film ever again. I gave the movie a five because the good scenes are REALLY good, just too far and in between for me. I felt like I was watching ""The Family Stone""-another movie about a completely unlikable family. Steve Carrell's character would be best to ditch the fam, move to Paris with Juliette's character and forget they knew the horrid family they left behind. Steve Carrell might have an understated Oscar-worthy performance somewhere deep inside, but it's not here folks.",sadness
"I've seen this movie in the cinema ten years ago when I was younger and now, after seeing it again, I'm surprised that I still get the same emotions from it. In my review, I'll try to stay away of spoilers but I'll also give you a good treatment of the plot as well (just the big-picture).Movie starts as Baran, an old eskiya (a honorable bandit) is getting out of prison after 35 years of jail to find his village and his home under the waters of Firat river. He then learns that his confinement was due to an old comrade's betrayal, and that his comrade took away and married his lover, Keje. Baran comes to the biggest city of Turkey, Istanbul to seek his old comrade and maybe to take revenge...Due to an unlikely coincidence, he meets Cumali, a young man that has no family and is living in Istanbul, earning his life with criminal acts. Baran the Eskiya is not familiar with the city-life but Cumali is willing to help him because of his debt.Baran the eskiya has a deep character, despite his criminal past, he looks like a naive person in the metropolitan city of Istanbul. Despite that he is an uneducated person, he may be the most honorable and wise person in this big city. Sener Sen (Baran) and Ugur Yucel (Cumali) each gives spectacular acting performance and their talents combined with an intelligent script breathe life into this ""Eskiya"" myth. Baran is the last of the Eskiyas !The movie has a slow start but towards the ending, the mood gets stronger. The movie reaches it's climax at the dramatic scenes to the finish. This is a story about honor and the power of love. This is a story about two strangers that are becoming tied emotionally, like the father and the son. A classic Turkish Action/Drama movie for all to see ! PS. also check out another Turkish movie ""Kabadayi"" by the same director/writer (Yavuz Turgul) and the same actor (Sener Sen).",sadness
"The non-stop jokes, off-color humor, slapstick and under 90 minute running time of ""The Dictator"" hearkens back to early Woody Allen gems like ""What's Up Tiger Lily,"" ""Take The Money and Run,"" ""Bananas,"" and ""love and Death. And, in the world of comedy, that's quite a compliment.Like Cohen, Allen's first films were often misunderstood. Some folks just did not get the joke. Many still don't get it today. The object of comedy has always been to take down the high and mighty by whatever means necessary. And, if you happen to be a Middle Eastern despot, you will find much to be offended by here. But, as Allen often did as well, Cohen uses racial and gender stereotypes to shine a light on people's attitudes, and that's likely to put off others as well. That's fine. Some comedy just isn't for everyone.While his writing style owes much to Allen, his acting chops are also influenced heavily by one of Britain's greatest comics, Peter Sellers. You can see it in his outrageous accents and in his ridiculous pratfalls. Like Sellers, Cohen is fearless in his characterizations and, again, like Sellers, there will be those who will take offense in this. Again, not for everyone. But, if you laughed your butt off at Sellers' simpleton Indian character destroying a Hollywood party, you will be laughing here too.And that's what we're talking about; laughs. Not every joke works. Many fall flat. But the film starts off fast and furious with a rapid succession of gags, most of which work hilariously, settles down for a bit and then takes off again, literally. His verbal sparring with co-star Jason Mantzoukas is one of the highlights as are many of the fun cameo appearances and a running joke about his name that I will not reveal here. There are many great sight gags that are easily missed and the appearance of his Efawadh character at the U.N. channels a scene right out of Allen's ""Sleeper."" There's a few scatological and sex jokes also (one about excrement, one about urination, one about masturbation, several about body parts), and these, if you ask me, are the low point of the film (except a child birth scene that's as funny as it is outrageous). But, the bodily fluid gags, so rampant in comedy films today, are actually few and far between. And there's a bit of a message, too.We're not dealing with ""Citizen Kane"" here. But, then, this film made me laugh much more.",sadness
"This movie tells the painfully true story, which has not quite been told. The story of torture and of systematic rape during the Bosnian war. The story is not easy to tell, especially in a short movie, but Jolie proves to be an incredibly skillful first time director. What I especially liked, is that at the end of the movie, we see that Ajla, one of the protagonists, is not just an innocent Bosniak girl in love with her captor; the audience gets a glimpse of Ajla's hatred for the man she is portrayed as having a love relationship with, through the entire movie. Angelina has been stating in interviews that she never intended to direct a movie, when she decided to learn more about the Bosnian war. What she learned had affected her deeply, as it should be the case for any human being, and it really shows in how well the movie depicts the story. In an incredibly thoughtful way, Jolie selected the cast of new and celebrity actors, mainly of Serbian ethnic origin, with whom she worked closely in creating the movie and representing the story of the war. Nearly everyone has heard of the war in Bosnia and the ethnic cleansing of the Bosnian Muslims. It was being documented on the front line news as it was happening, with the world not intervening, as had been the case with Rawanda, and later Sudan. However the details of the horrific torture and rape, still remain under-reported. I work as a medical doctor in Canada, where I completed my medical education. Today, while seeing a consult in the hospital where I work, I happened to see a young patient whose mother and father had both been in separate concentration camps in Bosnia, the Serbian militia run camps. Her mother, a Bosnian Croat, was there, with the patient. She told me about suffering of post-traumatic stress disorder for many years, and of years of ineffective therapy, including Etc. Of watching her husband, a Muslim, suffer, until suddenly falling ill and dying of cancer recently; he had refused any mental health care or pharmacological treatment here in Canada, for his psychological trauma. She spoke about how they were forced on buses,of what happened to the rest of her family, as if it had just happened yesterday. She only mentioned that she had lived through horror, it was all in response to my question of whether there was any family history of mental health issues. I had just recently seen ""In the Land of Blood and Honey"", and as this woman was speaking to me, I almost told her about having watched the movie made about her story. Of course, I could not say something like that. This woman was weeping as she talked about her life. She seemed to get lost in that past, as she talked.It made me think of how sad it is, for these people who have been uprooted, having lived in a rural Bosnian town for generations, and coming here to where there would be peace, but where they would never find peace. They came here not knowing anybody, in a strange new land, not being able to speak the language, and unable to use the skills they had been able to make living on, back in Bosnia. I then saw these reviews and was saddened to see how the Serbian extremists are still vocal. Although there still exist Nazis and skinheads, the Holocoust has been acknowledged long ago,and not only officially, by the German people. This happened soon after the WWII. When, and will this ever be the case with the Serbian population at large? In the movie, the Bosnian Muslims are often referred to as "" the Turks"", a derogatory label, by the Serbian soldiers. Bosnian people are not descendants of the Ottoman Turks, although, personally, being of Bosniak ethnicity, I would have nothing against having Turkish roots, or for that matter,roots of any other origin. There was no motive for this war, or for the ethnic cleansing that went on, aside from the sheer hatred, cruelty and the crazed nationalism and extremism. From a rational perspective, it would have made more sense if the Serbs had started killing random Turkish citizens in Turkey, to avenge having to live under the Ottoman empire rule for centuries. Of course, as absurd as this sounds it would make more sense. The only crime of the the Bosnian Muslims victims is that they were Muslim. And, yes, the principal victims of the war and the ethnic cleansing were the Bosnian Muslims, of whom at least 100, 000 were killed (though the figure is often minimized), but also millions exiled and uprooted. It is untrue and absurd to say that ethnic cleansing "" was committed by all sides"", as some reviewers here claim. It is not difficult to understand and know this. It is impressive, that of all people, Angelina Jolie, has made this important movie, and told the hardly believable, but true story of Bosnian women's war experience.",sadness
"""Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey"" is a beautiful, charming, emotional and timeless classic, as well as one of the best animal movies. But I can't say the same about its sequel.""Homeward Bound II: Lost in San Francisco"" is not a bad film. For a sequel, it's not all that bad. It is still entertaining enough and features the same main cast (except Don Ameche, who passed away in 1993). But the movie just can't reach the greatness of the first one, so the fact that it is disappointing comes to me as no surprise. This movie simply doesn't follow the spirit of the original neither the spirit of others like it.The plot is somewhat similar to the first one's. However, instead of the Sierra mountains, this one takes our 3 pet friends to the urban life, more precisely to the worst streets of San Francisco. Basically it focus more on desert roads, empty streets and dirty alleys. We don't see that much of San Francisco, neither of its most beautiful things. This is a radical contrast with the first movie's environment, which shows us all the beauty of pure nature in the Sierra mountains.In this film, our buddies Shadow, Chance and Sassy often face city's dangers, such as weird people, two dog catchers who lock street dogs in their van to take them to one of those creepy laboratories and two rival dogs: a vicious boxer-like dog and a goofy bulldog-like dog, despite the help of numerous street dogs (Riley and his gang).The two rival dogs are particularly annoying, especially the boxer-like dog. Most of the street dogs here are annoying either, except for Delilah (a beautiful Kuvasz) and Riley. As for the dog catchers, the driver isn't that annoying, but his partner is. On the other hand, the cute little boy Tucker was adorable and his cute kitten Tiger too.The movie isn't nostalgic, emotional or charming like the first one. While it has some funny gags, it isn't humor as pleasant as in the first one. The soundtrack isn't as good as in the first one, although this one still has some good music.One of the few really good things in this movie is the Golden Gate Bridge (the enormous bridge in San Franciso), a construction that always fascinated me.",sadness

"Went to see this because my fiancé thought the previews were funny. Admittedly, the previews I had seen made it look funny as well, but I had read some critical reviews, and wasn't enthusiastic. As it turned out, the critics were right, and I applaud the marketing geniuses who were actually able to make ""Arthur"" look even remotely entertaining. Brand, who I usually like, was nothing better than annoying, and he might have been the best one in the cast. The dialog was silly in parts and completely corny in others, the premise was poorly executed, and the six people at the showing I attended never let out anything more than a slight giggle from time to time, probably out of embarrassment for the performers more than anything else.On the plus side, if my fiancé ever criticizes any of my cinematic choices, I can remind her of this tripe. That ought to put an end to that conversation.",sadness
"Granted ""A Perfect Vacation"" (aka ""Awaken"") had scored relatively low here on IMDb and given the ensemble of cast that starred in this movie, I just wasn't sure whether or not I would sit down to watch it. I ended up doing so, solely because it had Daryl Hannah listed on the cast list.The movie starts out well enough, although the storyline didn't really make all that much sense in terms of being realistic or particularly entertaining. The storyline in ""A Perfect Vacation"" was weak and vague, and most often seemed like a muddy mess of random ideas thrown out there and put into a not particularly coherent order.The setting of the movie was quite good, with the jungle and the Island. So there were some nice enough visuals throughout the movie, although this was hardly enough to make up for the many shortcomings of the movie.There are some familiar names on the cast list, including Edward Furlong, Vinnie Jones, Christa Campbell and Jason London, although these are hardly talents that I am overly impressed with much less fan of these people. Alongside these were Daryl Hannah, Robert Davi and also David Keith, the two selling points for the movie in my opinion.25 minutes into the movie and I already found my interest in the movie quickly waning and my attention span started to drift elsewhere. But still I decided to stick with the movie and see how it would turn out.The movie is very predictable, and of course sharks would show up once people were getting off the Island to escape the horrible ordeal that takes place on the Island.The characters in the movie were adequate, although there was not much of any character development going on. But the characters have enough details and personalities to keep remaining interesting enough to bear witness to as the movie trotted on in a very monotone pace.""A Perfect Vacation"" was just barely entertaining enough for a single viewing, but trust me, it was a hard pressed one. More than once was I tempted to get up and find something else to watch. Should you make it through the entire movie the first time, chances of you returning to it a second time is as likely as snow on the sun.",sadness

"With two Rambo movies, First Blood (1982) and Rambo : First Blood part II (1985) under his commando belt, Sylvester Stallone had confidently confirmed himself as the Box Office king of the Action Thriller genre. With all the gingoism and American flag waving that went with the comic strip adventures of the worlds favourite fictional viet nam vet, Stallone steps up a gear into Cobra (1986), one of the tightest, exciting, well written and under-rated action movies of the past few decades. Stallone takes British crime novelette Running Duck (US - Fair Game} from celebrated writer Paula Gossling and gives it the full Rambo gloss treatment. Gone from the novel is the alcoholic schizoid lead character and in his place is Marion Cobretti, the typical, four square Stallone character, and the story is all the better for this. Stallone' screenplay is pretty simple, and so is the under lying message that evil is a force that must be met on its own terms. So what we have is a violent actioneer chock full of punch ups, car chases and shooting. Sadly, the script isn't developed enough, and the Rocky elemnts so typical of Stallone's movies at this point, IE, the underdog hero who everyone is against, is used to the maxim here. Unlike the Rocky movies, the glare of humour isn't up to scratch, and so a great many of the lead characters are unlikeable. So what? Wasn't this the case with thrillers such as Seven or Resovoir Dogs? However, Rambo Director George Pan Cosmatos gives a fresh coat of paint to this particular movie, adding stylish touches of film noir to the action genre in a way that precceeds Face/Off (1997) and a whole host of successors. Bridgette Nielsen is the movies real surprise, giving a likeable and sincere performance as Helgar, under the watchful eye of her then Husband. What is really surprising is that Cosmatos manages to succesfully blend into the action genre touches of classic and contemporary horror movies such as Friday the Thirteenth and John Carpenters Halloween with the chilling depiction of the Night Slashers. The movie also contains some of the most exhilerating action and chase sequences, particularly in the movies climax, where Cobra lets rip unto the Night Slashers men. This is an under-rated gem, a very efficient Stallone/George Pan Cosmatos vehicle, and very possibly the best ever Menahem Golan, Yoram Globus/Cannon Film Group picture ever produced. .......................................................................8/10",sadness

"Some people have criticised the way this film is directed but my own complaint is the way it's produced and it's probably not a valid complaint because it's produced unreservedly for a female audience , though strangely enough male voters on this site have awarded it a slightly higher mark than females Apart from being the kind of movie that twenty something females can get together and watch on a Friday night with a bottle of wine it's difficult to understand the thinking behind it . Is it a star vehicle for Jennifer Aniston and Cameron Diaz ? If so why put two up and coming actresses in the same movie because they cancel each other out and Diaz role as Heather does seem slightly underwritten . In this type of movie people in general and men in particular never really act as they would in real life and while I'm not a fan of "" social realism "" in movies neither am I a fan of romantic comedies / chick flicks either Not to be to negative I did smile at at the line :"" She looks like she came from an island "" "" Yeah Rhode Island """,sadness

"Nicole Holofcener has become a must-see director. While lovely and Amazing was just that, Friends with Money tops it by bringing out the best in every actor involved (McDormand, Keener, Cusack and, yes, even Aniston are brilliant). At once quiet and frantic, the film captures beautifully the slow-boil tension between and among friends and lovers trying to attain or hold on to some semblance of humanity in a world where such goals are rarely rewarded. Critics who've bashed Aniston's performance are far too harsh; she holds her own in the company of three of today's greatest actresses.

"It seems that with each passing year, there comes a point in time when we will inevitably find the young and beautiful, Keira Knightly, in yet another period drama. It also seems like every period drama these days, whether it features Knightly or not, feels the need to disassociate itself from the conventions of the past and assert itself as fresh, with a unique twist on the genre. This is particularly challenging when the story is one we've seen a number of times prior. The true story of Georgina Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, as told by director, Saul Dibb, in THE DUCHESS, is one where a young girl of ""modest"" heritage is married off to an esteemed Duke for a price. Her duty is to serve his grace and provide to him a male heir. As a woman, she is nothing more than a decorative commodity and should she not be able to fulfill her wifely promises, then she is essentially useless. Dibb is smart about it though. With the point already made before the film even begins, he chooses to focus instead on the reality of this kind of imprisonment  what it feels like for a girl beneath her binding bodice.Knightly carries the weight of this film on her shoulders while carrying the weight of the wigs on her head with poise and prominence. Her big brown eyes go from playful to shy to distraught and defeated. When we first meet her, she is free and seemingly unaware of the heavier world outside of her backyard games. Before long though, she is face to face with adulthood. This particular face belongs to Ralph Fiennes as the Duke of Devonshire. It is here that Dibb steps in to add another layer to the played out trajectory. With an age difference that is only matched in vastness by the distance between them, the Duke undresses his Duchess and asks why women's clothing must be so complicated. There is no better occasion for small talk than before two practical strangers go to bed for the first time. Knightly, trying desperately to hide her nervousness, replies to the obviously rhetorical question though, claiming that this is the only way for women to express themselves in the times they live in. It is clear she is not sure that a reply is necessary or even allowed but it is also clear that she speaks to ensure that she is seen, that her person is present. Her clothing falls to the floor and the imprints of her corset can still be seen on the smooth of her back.Dibb follows this form of unexpected intimacy and insight with commentary about celebrity and how little the adoring public truly knows about their icons. The Duchess of Devonshire, or at least the one in THE DUCHESS, was an immense influence on her people. Her presence at events guaranteed crowds while her fashion determined the trends. Even her association with particular people could sway public and political opinion. She embodied grace and extravagance while remaining humble and the public ate it up. In their eyes, her life was perfect but those who traveled in closer circles knew better. They knew that there was little love between the Duke and Duchess and increased strain as she was not able to provide a male heir. Even they didn't know just how bad it was though. The wait staff on the other hand could have made millions on a tell-all. Like Stephen Frears' THE QUEEN, Dibb shows us what goes on on both sides of the castle gates, highlighting the drastic disconnect between the two close worlds. The Duchess was made to make many horrific choices and concessions that would have broken many a lesser person. What makes them so harrowing in the context of the film is the plainness with which they are expected by the Duke and subsequently accepted by all involved.THE DUCHESS is shocking on many levels. It is shocking how harsh it is underneath its polished finish and how new this old tale feels. It is shocking how well Knightly can hold her pain and her own. And it is shocking how little value and worth was once afforded the women of the world. But it is perhaps most shocking that the manner in which women were once seen as a male possession, with purpose and function that only serves the male agenda, still exists today, no matter how you dress it up.",sadness

"Two strangers in their desperate times seek solace from the edges of George Washington bridge to end their respective traumas caused by the stock market meltdown and betrayal in love by a childhood boyfriend. After several failed attempts to commit suicide together, Kiara (Priyanka Chopra) is convinced that they were meant to live together for a little longer to fulfill their bucket list. Akash (Ranbir Kapoor) is unsure but finds his comfort in her happiness. From a wish to be stranded in the middle of the ocean to taking a long drive through Nevada to even falling in love, the duo fulfill many of their wishes through a series of misadventures that are only partly entertaining and otherwise insipid. Indeed, Ranbir has his first sorely disappointing movie resulting from the flawed direction by Siddharth Anand, who gave us 'Hum Tum', 'Salaam Namaste' and 'Bachna Ae Haseeno'. The lackluster and tedious tale of two strangers, 'Anjaana Anjaani' is a major let down that boasts of little apart from its cinematography and music.The viewer simply cannot connect with the gravity of the circumstances of the protagonists. When such a heartthrob lead pair is expected to engage the audience with romance, laughter and fun, their vain attempt in conveying any sort of seriousness goes unnoticed. Blame the script for trying too hard to push some bitterness down our throats when we're expecting candy. When it comes to performances, the issue is not that Ranbir has only played the charismatic lover boy. Remember 'Rocket Singh' and 'Raajneeti'? We know he is capable but here, he seems lost because of the script. He is only himself in the song Tumse Hi Tumse where the irony is that the 'cool' Ranbir is only an imagination. Priyanka Chopra definitely has the better role of the two but such weakness in her character coupled with an uninspiring partner doesn't lead to much chemistry. One can only look back at Kareena's character in 'Jab We Met' and appreciate Imtiaz Ali's beautiful characterization that was played so vivaciously. Kiara is just too artificial, unreal and no fun to be with. Ranbir's boredom is thus apparent in the light of such partnership. What the duo are truly missing is a third partner. Had Siddharth cast a comedian as their companion, the film would've been a lot more entertaining. Vinay Pathak, Johnny lever, Sharman Joshi, Ritesh Deshmukh and Arshad Warsi are just some of the brilliant supporting actors who could've made the film so enjoyable. Oh well.The film's strength is of course, its music. At 52, Lucky Ali can still deliver the most rocking song of the year with the brilliantly picturized Hairat. Aas paas Khuda though unwanted in the film is beautifully rendered by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan. Anjaana Anjaani (Vishal & Shilpa Rao) will be among the memorable tracks with outstanding composition and melodious singing. Mohit Chauhan has another hit in his bag withTujhe Bhula Diya which is a unique fusion song, the best one after Mora Piya earlier this year. Shekhar & Caralisa Monteiro (Rock On! fame) make Tumse Hi Tumse the most hummable tune that puts a spring in every step when you listen to it. The few scenes that stand out include the sequence in the middle of the ocean and the gay club dance followed by the hilarious encounter. Among the rest of the cast, Zayed Khan is an insult to the name of his character! His screen presence is overkill in this 150 min drama and adds no value to the wafer thin plot. Priyanka won't be signing future projects based on this film and Ranbir would at best try to get over playing the serious-lost-romantic soul who needs redemption. Siddharth Anand also takes liberty in placing too many songs that outweigh the plot itself. Most of the story progresses in the songs and Vishal-Shekhar have done a brilliant job in engaging us with catchy tunes. They are greatly supported by Ravi Chandran's cinematography that is quite spectacular in shots of New York City, Nevada and San Francisco. While the songs, few comic scenes and dashing appearances of the lead actors may draw die- hard fans to the theaters, they will be let down by the plot, length, script and above all, the direction that simply fails to engage and entertain. The attempt to combine a serious subject such as suicide and depression with romance and adventure falls flat on the audience's brain that expects to see contemporary cinema with aspects they can take home. In this case, let the strangers play their tunes and watch them from afar if possible. 6.31 on a scale of 1-10.",sadness

And the film did make me think about my life and what it is like to deal with death in sudden fashion, like a plane crash. Don't think they'll be showing this one as an in-flight movie. I've heard that Sony kept this film quiet so it wouldn't interfere with the Oscar buzz Ann Hathaway's getting for Rachel Getting Married. Which makes sense, but I feel bad for all the people that worked on the film. They must feel abandoned by the studio.",sadness
"I don't write many reviews, unless I really feel close to the movie or believe it was unfairly rated, like this one. This movie has found it's way back to my DVD player several times since it's first release to DVD about 10 years ago. It whisks you up from your easy chair to a sunny vacation spot in the Polynesian Islands and never slows up or misses a beat. One scene moves to the next in a seamless manner often foreshadowed by a soundtrack that is very good and quite catchy.The film was well cast with Harrison Ford as the crusty cargo pilot - Ann Heche as the assistant editor of a fashion magazine - David Swimmer as her pasty but very nice fiancé and Jacqueline Obradors as the beautiful but dingbat club dancer. This romantic comedy and action adventure film pits two people together from different backgrounds and age groups. Normally the two would never get along long enough to get to know the other. But, forced to spend time together and under challenging conditions, a small attraction begins to develop and grow stronger. The character development of the cast moves forward with the same speed as the rest of this cute story.While the film is certainly not for everyone, judging from IMDb ratings and rotten tomatoes, I really believe it was the message and not the movie that failed to impress. This story expresses a throwback to traditional values in the relationship of Ford and Heche and their experiences on the Island. This may explain the reaction to the film by many of the younger viewers. Some of the more mature viewers may have been turned off by news of Ann Heche and Ellen Degeneres in real life. This may explain why some seem to love the movie, while others have curiously rated it rather poorly.In any case, if you need a quick escape and love flying to beautiful Polynesian Islands loaded with beautiful scenery and good-looking people, then his film may be your ticket!",sadness
"I hate to be harsh, really, but I love to be sincere.Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan are both great, really, and the film is good nevertheless, unfortunately, it results hard to like and I am afraid that the reason is the music. As in the purest Opera tradition, this musical is a non-stop singing drama. Melodies, however, are not catching and that's where and why (on my humble opinion) it flops.Without disturbing the masters (Mozart, Verdi or even Berg), it should be recalled that even Operettas' Authors like Lehar or Leoncavallo built their fortunes on easy to recall, enjoyable tunes. And that writing both the Musical score and the Libretto (as Wagner, most notably, did) usually leads to heavier results.",sadness

"I just went to the GONE premiere. I don't know the filmmakers. Got a ticket through a friend at Summit. Here's the deal: GONE is an expertly crafted and calibrated serial killer thriller, the kind of genre movie that is usually undermined by bad acting and silly scripting. But here everything works together very well. Amanda Seyfried is a convincing and beautiful lead; the supporting cast with Wes Bentley, Jennifer Carpenter and Michael Pare, is solid. The pace is relentless. The script is tight and cleverly constructed. The whole thing works; the scenes fly by; the direction and editing reinforce each other. I never looked at my watch. The movie is a bullet. GONE delivers.",sadness
"The 1993 Jean-Claude Van Damme martial arts action-adventure ""Nowhere to Run"" ranks as one of the Belgian-born martial arts sensation's better, more theatrical presentations because according to some, it allows Van Damme a little more time to shine as a performer. While it is true that ""Nowhere to Run"" is one of Van Damme's better vehicles (which doesn't say a whole about his career as a whole), unfortunately it falls too easily to genre conventions.By 1993, ""Nowhere to Run"" was Hollywood's latest attempt to humanize the Muscles from Brussels, by turning him into a romantic lead. As Sam, the sympathetic convict who manages to engineer a daring jailbreak on-board a prisoner-transport bus, we get, as audience members, to see a more sensitive side of Van Damme that we haven't seen before. Of course, the problem is that the plot doesn't allow Van Damme to develop beyond genre stereotype. He's a person of little depth or emotional range, so that further complicates any attempt of an emotional connection to his character.In terms of plot, based on a story by ""Basic Instinct"" Joe Eszterhas and the late Richard Marquand with a script written by Eszterhas, Leslie Bohem and Randy Feldman, ""Nowhere to Run"" is a shameless rehash of the classic western ""Shane,"" which offers nothing new for us and Our Hero is no Alan Ladd. After the escape, Sam winds up on the Anderson farm, and manages to catch a glimpse of the Mrs. Anderson, widow Clydie (Rosanna Arquette), as she strips off her clothes to take a bath in one gratuitous (and brief) full-frontal shot, and thus Sam and us are reduced to peeping Toms.Clydie is living with her two young children Mookie (Kieran Culkin, Macaulay's younger brother) and Bree (Tiffany Taubman). Clydie is also battling a greedy land developer (Joss Ackland, the go-to person for senior Hollywood villains) who has sent his hired goons to try to muscle her into selling her land. And who comes to her rescue other than Sam, who kick-boxes the bad guys away in some pretty mediocre fight scenes. And thus, hesitantly, Sam is welcomed into the family, and eventually Clydie's bed, taking on the role of a surrogate father and husband. To further complicate matters, a local sheriff who also vies for Clydie's affections is still snooping around, taking bribes from the land developers as he tries to convince her to sell her land.""Nowhere to Run"" isn't high on intelligence or character development. That can be forgiven, presumably, since this is an action film - a Van Damme action film, no less. The problem is, the film offers nothing new to the outlaw-on-the-run genre, or the western, or even the martial arts genre. Of course once Sam's cover is blown, he has nothing else to do to but go on the run once more, anywhere, nowhere - with a fixed-up Triumph motorcycle - but a sudden attack of conscience forces him to journey back to the Anderson farm where he gets into a fight with the land developer's hired goons and a venomous, card-shuffling chief henchman (go-to surrogate bad guy Ted Levine).Van Damme speaks very little here but does pack somewhat of a punch in his fight scenes, as the sympathetic convict-hero. There's little of his dynamic acrobatics here, which is probably more of his Hollywood reformation into a romantic action lead. Arquette is beautiful, but she isn't really given a whole lot to do other than be beautiful and a damsel-in-distress and something of a babysitter rather than a widowed mother. The director, Robert Harmon, who showed promise with the visceral ""The Hitcher"" in 1986, treads overly familiar territory, and his direction seems lacking, even in the action scenes.Then again, ""Nowhere to Run"" starts out going nowhere a little fast, but quickly starts to run on empty.5/10",sadness
"(Synopsis) In 1989, Mike O'Donnell (Zac Efron) is a high school senior and star athlete, who is heading for college on a basketball scholarship. But instead, Mike must give up his dreams, because his girlfriend Scarlett (played by Allison Miller - teenager) is pregnant. Twenty years have gone by and Mike is not living the good life. Mike must move in with his wealthy software genius nerd and best friend, Ned Freedman (Thomas Lennon), because he is separated from his wife Scarlett (played by Leslie Mann – adult). Mike has two teenage children, and he doesn't have a good relationship them either. At work, Mike has been passed over for another promotion again, because he doesn't have a college degree. Mike has hit rock bottom so he returns to his high school to reminisce his glory days. He shares his feelings with the school janitor how great things were when he was 17. On his way back to Ned's house, Mike is changed into a 17 year-old again. Mike returns to high school to finish the life he thought he should have had.(My Comment) The story is a 'what if' story of things that could have been. We don't know how life will treat us when we go down a different path. Where would I be if I had gone to college, joined the army, or not married Scarlet? But what people don't realize is that you only have one life, and you can never go back. You must live the life you have and make it better, if you can. If you want to change the world, make a change to your world, and you change the world. Mike realizes that he hasn't been a good father or husband. He discovers why he fell in love with Scarlet in the first place, and what he has missed by not being closer to his children. Mike already had a perfect life, he just didn't appreciate it. Zac Efron does a good job of making you believe that he is the father of his two children in the scenes he has with them. The storyline is predictable, and we have seen it before, but if you want to see a feel good movie that will keep the whole family entertained throughout, this is a good movie to see. It also has a moral to the story that you don't know what you have until you lose it. (New Line Cinema, Run Time 1:42, Rated PG-13)(7/10)",sadness
"""The Reader"" is full of interesting ideas, but it suffers from lacklustre execution.The central question at the heart of the story is whether or not we'll ever be able to distance ourselves enough from the Holocaust to understand how it was allowed to happen. Categorizing every person who played a role in it as a monster is easy and it provides an emotional catharsis, but it also prevents us from learning from history. After all, not every person who worked in a concentration camp was evil -- many of them were just people doing their jobs without any of the historical context we now have. And if we disregard them as something inhuman, we won't be able to know how to prevent something similar from happening again.This question plays out in the story of Hannah, a former concentration camp guard (played by Kate Winslet), and Michael, played as a young man by David Kross and as an older man by Ralph Fiennes. Hannah and David have an affair before David knows of Hannah's past, and comes across her again years later when he's a law student and she's on trial as a war criminal. David must reconcile his loathing of what Hannah did with the fact that he knows she's not a monster. Hannah's real shame are not her crimes, but rather the fact that she never learned to read, and the film's best moments come in the third act when Michael, as a way of expiating some of the guilt he feels at not coming to Hannah's defense when he knew information that would have helped her case, records himself reading some of Hannah's favorite stories and sends them to her in prison.""The Reader"" is a solid piece of film-making, but it has that ever-so-slightly-embalmed quality that comes when a director and writer feel the need to be too respectful to the source material. It's sombre and tactful and always feels more like a filmed book than a movie. It never comes cinematically alive. It boasts good performances, especially from Winslet and Lena Olin, who has brief dual roles as mother and daughter concentration camp survivors. And it has one all-too-brief thrilling sequence in which Winslet's character decides to spend her time in prison learning to read -- just watch Winslet's face as Hannah recognizes the word ""the"" for the first time. Otherwise, it's the kind of movie to admire rather than fall in love with.Grade: B+",sadness

"Although this movie is a bit typical, it's still a breezy, light hearted romp, which is all it appears to be trying to do. It's got formulaic construction familiar in romantic comedies, yet it knows it's just harmless fluff and doesn't try to be anything more.Kathryn Heigl is certainly the strength of the film, with an exuberant approach to her ""hopeless romantic"" always the bridesmaid character who longs for that special day of her own. The performance is playful and silly when needed, and sweetly honest in the more serious moments. The rest of the cast are all good, too; the personality collisions of various characters are usually well done. The sight gags involving the dresses are clever, and the story runs its course effectively.There are weaknesses, such as the ugly, mean spirited, and out-of-place slide show sequence. The script could have accomplished the point which is made there in some better way.Light popcorn fun.

"A writer Alice (Brittany Murphy) gets dropped off by a friend at a spooky Victorian house, to be alone for a week to write. Her friend drives off leaving Alice alone to explore the house and as she does she finds mini video cassettes of the former residents, a young couple, going about their daily lives. The rest of the movie jumps between the present, the author in the house, and the past, what is happening to the couple's lives by watching the tapes. Even with the dual story line there is no character development, at all. There isn't a reason to even care about what happens to them. You don't know what their goals or hopes are, or their past. Except in a the simplest of references. Like: ""He had a history of depression"". So when the movie jumps between past and present you don't even want to even bother to try to and figure it out. And Brittany Murphy has the complete inability to keep her mouth closed. As in, lips together, so it looks like she is gasping for air like a fish out of water. She wanders through the entire movie with eyes bugged out and lips apart, brow furrowed (not literally of course with the advent of Botox) and saying nothing because this takes place in an empty house there really isn't a lot of dialogue. I am wondering what the point of this movie was. I really am. No conflict, mute fish-like characters, no plot really or story...hmm. I gave it a 4 because the camera work and production was decent and the bad acting was due to a sophomoric script. This isn't even a good rainy day desperation I will watch this, because nothing is on cable type movie. And Thora Birch was in this so I mistakenly thought it would improve. There is a last gasp at the end to try to scare you but seriously. After an hour and 10 minutes of nothing it is kind of hard to recover. And these movies with the tired plot line of people who are mentally ill and/or on medication is so old. EVERYONE IS ON MEDICATION.

"I give this movie 5 because this could have been a decent movie to watch. However, it was let down in more than one aspects and its a pity as this was the debut movie of 2 actors who did show potential.So in this review I will highlight all the good things in the movie and how it was let down.First the plot. Well as with most bollywood movies it followed the age old formula of arranged marriage vs love marriage. However, it did have some new perspectives which could have been interesting. However, the movie fails to develop on these perspectives and hence the plot feels a bit empty or shallow.Second the acting. Though it wasn't exemplary I would say the actors weren't too bad. In fact Kriti Sanons acting was quite fine. However while Tiger shroff's acting wasn't all that bad, terrible dialogue and weird lost expression scenes marred his performance. In almost every scene he repeats a cliché stupid dialogue and I found myself doing a facepalm at each of those times. Plus the weird expression of love on his face...another facepalm.Third and this is the part that impressed me, the action. Now surprisingly and as opposed to other over the top bollywood movies, the action sequences were good. The stunts were very authentic given the fact that Tiger Shroff is a martial artist.Finally, the film is riddled with sudden cut scenes whereby you find yourself suddenly in a different scene without any indication or clue whatsoever. Furthermore, at several places the music seems so out of place an awkward.Overall, I believe in an attempt to make the movie over melodramatic with terrible cliché dialogues and awkward music cuts the director spoiled what could have been a decent movie. But do watch it for the action.",sadness

"Guido Contini, a famous Italian director, is struggling with his next big film. He has no script and no inspiration, but everyone is counting on him. He tries to juggle both his new film, his wife, his mistress, his producer and his muse. Oh yeah, he also talks to his dead mother. Nine is an ambitious film, I'll give it that. Rob Marshall, the director of the Best Picture winner Chicago serves up a mix bag with Nine. The film feels like Marshall is trying to rekindle the magic he had with Chicago, he comes up short, specifically with the musical numbers. For everything that I liked about it, there were two things I didn't. Nine needs to be more focused and shorter for it to be a film I would recommend. The film is about film-making, yet the way Marshall presents the film to us is in the style of a stage play. Everything from the set-pieces to lighting screams stage play. It was an interesting touch, but felt out of place because it dealt with the art of film-making so much. The musical numbers, all uninspiring and rather boring, even attest to this. With the exception of Fergie, who gives us the best song and dance number that uses sand in a creative way, all the other numbers are generic and rather 'not good'. When you have a Grammy winner singing a song and then have Kate Hudson sing one, there is a difference, and it is more noticeable than the filmmakers might have wanted.Nine has a great cast, most of them are Oscar winners too. Daniel Day Lewis, with an amazing Italian accent, is the obvious stand out. He plays sexy and stressed all in one look. Penelope Cruz is the mistress, who has the sexiest scene of this movie, her career and this year. Her work in this film is pretty basic, the other lover who wants to be the one loved. With the exception of DDL, the only other actor that is given any kind of emotional depth is Marion Cotillard. She has to go through the realization that her husband is cheating on her and make the choice to stay or leave. Everyone else is pretty much there to fill up time and sing their one song. Judie Dench is the fashion designer and she plays a motherly figure, whereas Sophia Loren plays his actual mother, well his dead mother, but he still sees and talks to her. Fergie has her one scene in which she steals the show with her tune and then Nicole Kidman turns up at the end and makes you wince with her accent. Don't get me started on Kate Hudson.The problem is that these are good actors, with just no material to work with. Daniel Day Lewis is great, but he's a hard character to connect with, he's sleeping around with a lot of women, it feels like half the cast. Emotional scenes don't play out as well as they should and the film drags itself to the finish line near the end. I found myself wanting it to end sooner and sooner, but it kept going. On the plus side, the choreography is great and the cinematography really grabs you, even if it is a little misplace with it's stage feel. The film is well put together and the editing is well done. It weaves it's story in and out of timelines from Guido's life, during the musical numbers. The film isn't bad, but it didn't do anything for me either. Leaving a musical not tapping your toes or even remembering the tunes may be a bad sign. I liked it enough to give it a good rating, the cast and style are good enough for me to do so, but everything else makes me lean on the side of telling you to rent this. It's well made, but has no real heart and the film is a little on the long side, you may be checking your watch.",sadness

"This is one of Hitchcock's most well-known movies. Along with Psycho, it's the movie that most people identify with him. Many pages have been written about it and surely there will be more. I know that the superb technical aspects of the movie have been discussed a lot, so I'll try to focus on something I noticed yesterday when I watched it.It's scarier when there are no birds on screen. The tension, the silence, the uncertainty, the mystery. That's what suspense is about.I was amazed of how carefully Hitchcock builds the suspense in this movie. You watch the birds standing there, and they do not move, they are just waiting. Even when you think they are dumb something tells you they are thinking. They are analyzing your moves.This was possible with the aid of a top-notch screenplay, and great performances of the actors. This was probably the most difficult film for Hitchcock, specially for the technical aspects that were involved, but when you watch it, it really was worth the pain.The main plot is well-known: Melanie Daniels(Tippi Hedren),a young girl goes to Bodega Bay looking for Mitch Brenner(Rod Taylor),a handsome man she met in San Francisco, when suddenly, the birds start attacking humans by no reason. Pretty straight forward, and by this date very outdated, but Hitchcock adds his magic and the script spices this with the very complex relationships between the characters.The complex relationship between Mitch and his mother Lydia(played by Jessica Tandy), and the conflict that she has with Melanie is very interesting and brings back memories from Psycho. Also, Melanie's relationship with her own mother and the bond that she creates with Lydia and Mitch's 11 years old sister Cathy(Veronica Cartwright) is fascinating.The scene when the four of them are trapped inside the house with the birds waiting outside is classic; not only is, as I wrote above, a perfect example of the use of suspense, it is an awesome study of the characters and how their relation grows. I think that this particular movie was main inspiration for George A. Romero's claustrophobic climax in his landmark film ""Night of the Living Dead""(1968).The technical aspects may be the focus of many studies, but the characters deserve to be praised, even the support cast with a few lines develop a personality of their own. The restaurant scene is Hitchcock at his best with witty dialogs that are both humorous and creepy. Very good ensemble.Overall, this is an awesome movie, many reviewers have said it, I know. But I wanted to point that beyond the technical advances this experimental movie features, it is a perfect example of why Alfred Hitchcock is considered, ""The Master of Suspense"".9/10. Classic.",sadness

I wonder if Bill Bregoli might be the brother of The Forgotten's writer Gerald Di Pego, or perhaps the best friend of director Joseph Ruben? Or maybe he just got paid to say such a foolish thing. There simply is no way someone can compare The forgotten with The Sixth Sense and be serious about it. Or get away with it! The Forgotten is the worst kind of psychological thriller.

"""What Happens in Vegas"" reminds me of that great ""Seinfeld"" episode; the one where Jerry and George create a sitcom pilot about a traffic accident that results in the guy without insurance being the butler of the other man. It's the idiot plot, a concept that ""Vegas"" indulges in like a free buffet dinner. The movie proves that what happens in Vegas should sometimes just stay on the cutting room floor. The movie stars Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher as Joy and Jack. Joy got dumped by her boyfriend while Jack just got fired from his job. Both needing a pick-me-up, they are convinced by their friends (Rob Corddry, Lake Bell) to take a trip to Vegas, and after one wild and drunken night, the two wake up in the morning to find each other lying in holy matrimony. Not only that, but while trying to end the marriage, Jack wins a huge jackpot after playing Joy's quarter, throwing a wrench into the divorce proceedings. Whoever gets the other to divorce them first is entitled to the money, and so the ""happy"" couple move in with one another and hatch escalating schemes in order get the other to bail out of the marriage first. Only if you've seen this kind of thing before, what do you think happens when they come back from Vegas? It's a contrived sitcom from the start. Even before I went in I knew what I was getting myself into. Still, if the movie was funny it would more than make up for the complete lack of anything new. I was surprised with the kinetic and wild energy that director Tom Vaughan brings to the opening Vegas scenes, as it almost made me think that this movie may actually be likable. But then these two idiots wake up married and the movie slows to a halt. They each find one witless and unfunny way after another to get on the other's nerves. Joy hogs the bathroom, Jack pees in the sink, Jack rubs his balls then handles food, Joy throws food at him. At one point Jack gives himself a black eye to show that Joy is abusive. The movie wouldn't dare do it the other way around because, of course, spousal abuse on a wife isn't nearly as hilarious. I don't know what's more insulting, that the movie finds this crap funny or that in the last half it expects us to buy this phony romance based on life lessons and profound understanding. And then you have Kutcher and Diaz, two likable actors forced to play with bottom of the barrel material. Kutcher seems to know the material is terrible and tries to be comedic in his own way but the effort turns out to be more obnoxious and over-wrought instead. And Diaz is just shrill and unpleasant. We don't buy it when these two turn from being incredibly mean and nasty to one another to actually understanding the other and so the romance just flounders. On the upside, Rob Corddry is in the movie and he is fastly becoming comedy's best supporting player. ""What Happens in Vegas"" is just dumb. I expected nothing less, was hoping to be surprised with more, but am completely un-surprised by what I got. Sometimes you just have to roll the dice and see what happens though. Snake eyes!",sadness

"I love this movie!!  Sure I love it because of Madonna but who cares - it's damn funny!!! *ALANiS Rocks*.  When I first saw this film in the theatres back in 1987, I thought it was all out hilarious!  Madonna is so funny and I love her dubbed accent and wacky/funky look.  The all-time funniest part is when Madonna(Nikki) screams at a man who is about to get into a taxi.  And also when Griffin Dunne(Louden)trips and falls at the apartment interview scene.  **ALANiS Rocks**.  Madonna's character Nikki steals/shop lifts and fools people throughout the whole movie - her hilarious antics are enough to keep you on the floor the whole time.  ""Didn't rob nothin', when you rob a store you stick up the cashier.  We busted a few tapes, there's a bit of a difference""  I love that!!! It's classic. ***ALANiS Rocks***.  I don't know why this movie got slammed the way it did. I see nothing wrong with it - course maybe if you're a huge Madonna fan then whatever she does is just awesome.  Anyone out there who wants to see some funny, classic entertainment then watch ""Who's That Girl?""  And another very important fact that of which should be known to all man kind or at least to all that exist, ALANiS will always ""rock ya"" completely to the end! So does Madonna in this film, and just entirely! Her acting is superb!",sadness

"This movie is based on real location, Eloise Insane Asylum. Four young adults break into the now derelict Eloise to hunt for a death certificate needed to allow one of the four to claim his inheritance.With a great cast, excellent location and pretty good story it had all the ingredients of a solid horror. Unfortunately it just doesn't gel. There have been many movies similar which have been made much better such as Grave Encounters, Dark Feed, Reel Evil and Sanatorium. There was no atmosphere, it wasn't believable, the performances lacked charisma. It is a watchable film but is disappointing and not one that you would particularly want to re-watch.",sadness
"This is a such a nice and entertaining movie. As in David & Layla directed by Jalal Jonroy, My big fat Greek Wedding too celebrates the love and cultural differences. love, humanism, comedy, romance all are in that great film. My Big Fat Greek Weddeing brings people from different background closer and shows how important to accept the 'other' as other in order to be just happy! Being a migrant poses different problems and the individuals some times have to defy their original traditions and cultures to be able to love or be happy. In particular Greeks are very keen on and proud of their traditions and cultures (rightfully). I like the films which provide some insight and understanding of different cultures, or of individuals inner world. In this term My Big Fat Greeek Wedding does the job. That is why it is a very captivating film along with being funny enough to make you laugh even after you left the movie theater. I also recommend Mansoon Wedding, Bend It Like Beckham and David & Layla for the movie lovers. devrim kilic editor of www.kurdishcinema.org",sadness
"Where do I start? Fardeen Khan is easily one of the worst actors in Bollywood. Why do directors still give him roles when he hasn't done a performance worth remembering? Kareena was also bad! She screams herself silly in every second scene of project she participates in, an action unintentionally designed to make the audience go deaf. When she makes hideous faces at the camera every two minutes, you wish someone would make the burkha a mandatory covering for her visage.Both Kareena and Karisma started their careers as go-getting divas, but whereas the elder sibling has proved her mettle with unforgettable cinematic performances over the years, Kareena is all talk and little talent in this film. It wasn't until years later, Kareena started to do better films and improved in acting.I absolutely loved all the songs.

Of course, he's had plenty of practice in the past, whether it's Travis Bickle in ""Taxi Driver"" or Max Cady in ""Cape fear"" De Niro has specialized in dangerously off-the-wall roles and Renard is up there with the best of them. He lifts what is otherwise a conventional thriller, flashily directed by Tony Scott, into something memorable and relegates everyone else on screen into third base, in particular Ellen Barkin, the only female of note in the cast and even then used perfunctorily.

"I rented ""Hideaway"" solely because Jeremy Sisto was in it, and I have to say I was only somewhat disappointed. The movie's weakest points, and they are WEAK, are the completely gratuitous, TV-show quality special effects. I have never seen effects that were as utterly ridiculous to end a movie with.This is the sort of movie that reminded me,""Oh, yeah,THIS is why I hate special effects.""  However, aside from the mind-blowingly bad effects and the predictable plot, there is one very, diamond-bright spot in the movie, and that is Jeremy Sisto as the killer Vassago. Spookily sexy in trenchcoat and leather, he resembles a seriously psychotic ""Lost Boy"". Projecting an enchantingly evil sensuality, he is magnetic in his too-few scenes of dialogue. Truth to tell, if Vassago had cast the spell of his eyes and voice on me, I would have gone with him to a terrible fate. I found enjoyable also the heavy, death-metal soundtrack. (Although I am beginning to tire of the stereotype that killers in movies always listen to metal. What about all the drive-by shooters who listen to rap? But I digress) To sum up, unless you're a big Sisto fan I wouldn't bother. But if you are, Bon Appetit!",sadness

"I saw this movie BEFORE the original Korean horror film ('A Tale of Two Sisters' ) that it was based on and I found this a bland, blunter, popcorn shocker version of the film.The sole merit of this film is Emily Browning. She turns in a credible performance. You believe in her, makes you fear for her, and that's half the battle. So it's such a shame that the directors and screenwriters drop the ball so badly. Everything in this movie is SO geared to a major twist in the last reel that instead of making you bug out with its rug-pulling impact, like Sixth Sense or Usual Suspects do, it instead just makes you roll your eyes. Why? Because like those 2 films i've mentioned this flick lacks of any preceding foreshadowing or character nuance thus robbing the end twist of its intended impact. Oh, and the cheesy J Horror ghosts moments seem more Scary Movie than The Ring.The Korean original was creepier, confusing in parts but it comes together in the end and the cinematography is beautifully framed (one impressive shot comes out from underwater and up onto a deck where the titular sisters are sitting). The Guard Brothers ignore such artistry and go for a generic approach and when they do breakaway its to copy/homage a Kubrick helicopter shot from 'The Shining'.Strathairn (fantastic in Good Night + Good Luck) is wasted. Banks, who has proved her on screen versatility in an eclectic choice of roles in multiple pics over the past year, here goes for the fairy tale Step mother - the steel under her smile was borderline hammy but she definitely is one of the best (and overlooked) actresses in the business.All in all - avoid this film and seek out the Korean original instead but if it turns up on cable and you have 87 minutes to waste - watch it for Browning and Banks and the fun of yawning at a schlock-y story.

"An excellent comedy, Vince Vaughn is a gifted comedian. He kept ""Old School"" going, was the only light in a dismal ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"", and had a terrific debut lead in ""Swingers"". I highly recommend people considering this movie, to watch the extras on the DVD; there is a karaoke scene at an Asian wedding which will have you rolling. It is a shame it was cut from the movie, but as the director's comments stated, ""They just couldn't find a place where it would fit."" I was very pleasantly surprised at the number of times I laughed out loud, a rarity for me while watching comedies. The lines were witty, the delivery was crisp, and the jokes were mostly new and fresh. Rachel McAdams was stunning, an excellent casting choice to play the object of Owen Wilson's desire. Despite the more or less rehashed plot (two guys lie about themselves to meet women, only to find that they now have a dilemma when they find 2 they really like), the film is nonetheless novel and original. There are a number of obviously stereotypical characters, (drunken grandmother, artistic introverted son, psychotic cheating boyfriend, immoral mother, powerful father), but they work in this film. Particularly the grandmother, who is prone to drunken scatological exclamations, had me laughing my head off. It was quite unexpected.Although many of the situations could come off as contrived, they were secondary to the excellent repartee between Wilson and Vaughn. Their comic pairing worked to a T.R.",sadness

Bad boy Shane West is ordered to pull some community time tutoring and acting in a high school musical (uh, okaaay.).  `You can't make me act!' he vows to the judge, and then spends the rest of the movie proving it.

Uh, oh.hanky alert.

"You know, the one negative review I read here was that Anna Kendrick was awful. I would like to end those rumors now and say that only in the first song does she kinda suck. Even then it was beautifully acted: just painful to listen to. The only other reason I had to dock a star is that if you don't already know the general premise (she tells it backwards, he tells it forwards), you're screwed. There isn't a more eloquent way to put that. Besides that, this movie is perfect. Miss Kendrick has a very sweet voice that she (usually) knows how to use well, and Jeremy Jordan has one of the most beautiful tenors in the universe. They are both amazing actors, and they let it show. Composer Jason Robert Brown has given us this artwork of a score with whip smart lyrics to match. They take these songs and do what they can't do on stage, mostly to a hilarious effect. As long as you only know to mute the TV during ""Still Hurting"" (maybe even put Sherie Rene Scott's version on instead?) and the general premise, you're in for a great show.",sadness

Naturally all their families are somewhat strange and familiar (but funny) complications ensure.I saw this for a few reasons--it got good reviews from critics; it's been an OK hit (so far); I like Vaughn and Witherspoon and it's hard to resist a movie with FOUR Academy Award winning actors in supporting roles--Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, Mary Steenburgen and Jon Voight. It's not a great movie at all but it had a few good laughs and--at 88 minutes--it doesn't wear out its welcome. Supposedly Vaughn and Witherspoon didn't get along at all while working on this but you'd never know it from the film. They have some great chemistry and their comedic timing is right on target. The rest of the cast is as good as anyone could be and they all act well enough to make the entirely predictable story go down smoothly. It's not perfect. I could have lived without the TWO instances of projectile vomiting and Jon Favreau and Tim McGraw were too vicious and unfunny as Vaughn's brothers.

"This film is a typical example of why a revolution in film occurred in the 1960s and 1970s. One the one hand the producers of this 1960 film wanted to deal with controversial topics such as the hobo lifestyle and homosexuality, but they just couldn't avoid the traditional Hollywood studio compulsion to sanitize things. One particularly stupid example occurs very early in the film. The freight hopping hoboes are dressed like prep school students, and their clothes are amazingly clean and neat. Boxcars are FILTHY. I know this because I worked one summer loading them at a factory. An hour or two working in one and you look like you spent the night in a dumpster. As for the homosexuality, I completely missed that implication the first time I saw the film and only picked up on it after I read reviews here at IMDB. The producer and/or director just couldn't bear to make it too obvious, and that would have been easy to do. Homosexuality was common among hoboes, by the way. Like prisoners in jail, even straight hoboes engaged in it, as they had few other options.This could have been an excellent film, even with a low budget, if the producer didn't clean everything up so as not to offend audience members with delicate sensibilities. But then why did he show a rape/murder, a beating, and a near lynching? I guess those things were OK to watch in the ""heartland"" of America in 1960.",sadness

I guess I watched it because I'm getting married soon so I wanted to see the dresses in the film (and there are some amazing ones and some interesting ones for those who care about dresses).

This movie had enough drama and angst to appeal to my taste, yet the movie left me completely flat.  The progression of the story was positively sloth-like and the plot holes were enormous.  What should have been wrenching dramatic scenes ended up being distracting by poor histrionics and enough pauses to make Harold Pinter proud.  I found myself watching the clock several times, and literally forcing myself to finish the movie, which is extremely rare for this film addict, and when the conclusion finally occurred, I was left completely empty.The performances were fine, but Halle Berry certainly was not Oscar worthy. Nicole Kidman, of whom I was not a fan until Moulin Rouge should have taken the statue last year for turning out a performance that significantly exceeded Berry's in Monster's Ball.  If you're curious, like I was, watch this film.  But be sure to have a steady flow of caffeine handy.--Shelly",sadness
"This film was shown at my university tonight and Stoller was there for a Q&A after the screening. The film was the typical Apatow romp that we have seen as of late (Superbad, Knocked up, etc.). There was the usual crude and creative humor as well inappropriate sexuality to make another great Apatow team production. People should not come in with the expectation that this is another romantic comedy reincarnation of ""Knocked Up"". This is more of a typical and organic romantic comedy. The heavy emotional weight and issues in ""Knocked up"" are not present in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". The casting and comedic pacing was done very well and though it may not be a cinematic heavy hitter, it was very good for a directing debut and it was what movies all strive to be, entertaining.",sadness
"I was staying in on Saturday night and wanted to watch something light hearted and humorous. Friends with benefits seemed the perfect fit. Mila Kunis is usually talented and Justin Timberlake has done some good stuff. Add to it the glamour of NY and sharp comedy, things looked promising.I lasted about 30 minutes. I don't know how they managed turn talent and sharp humour into something so annoying. Mila Kunis came across as a fake, arrogant brat and Justin Timberlake had about as much charm as a broom stick. I ended up just being irritated by a lot of things in the film. Such as when Mila Kunis asks Justing Timeberlake if he thinks she's pretty. This is Mila Kunis - voted the sexiest woman in the world for god sake. They both have glamorous jobs, look perfect and have perfect blend of humour and wit...just too damn perfect with absolutely no touch of reality. Not even a hint of chemistry between the two.It's such a shame because Mila Kunis was excellent in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and her voice over work in Family Guy is brilliant. So I can only blame the director in this movie for turning her into such an annoying character. As for Justin Timberlake...bland, just bland.Irritating film. Luckily, Predator was on and saved the evening. At least Arnie can do proper humour.",sadness

"Being Of Cephallonian descent, I was happily surprised when watching the movie. I have heard the true history from my relatives that still live in Cephalonia, but when watching the movie and reading the book the sketchy bits of history were filled. It is all true, the Italians would sing, the oppression and the earthquakes that rock the island so often. The earthquake in 1953 killed my great grandfather and the book and movie both portray the feeling of the era with great compassion. If you haven't seen the movie go and watch it and read the book, it is not only a love story, and yes, there were plenty of Italians in love with Cephallonian women, in fact, boat loads of Cephallonian women were taken to Italy after the war, it is a true depiction of history.",sadness
"This movie worked for me because I see this movie as an exact opposite of 'Gone With The Wind.' Farm owners instead of plantation owners. Scarlett fights and connives for what she wants; Ada gets depressed and turns inside herself until Ruby, (Renee Zellweger,) shows up to save the day. Sort of, in a round about way. Deserters instead of officers trying to get back to their families, the lists goes on and on. Even the love story was opposite. If this is what the producer and writers were trying to get across it succeeded with me. There are only two things I didn't like about the movie, the rest I thought was well done and I liked it enough to recommend it to friends. First, I couldn't see the attraction between Inman, (Jude Law), and Ada, (Nicole Kidman,) as being strong enough for Inman to desert to get back to her. Inman said he only had written to her a few times where Ada wrote to him almost constantly. Second, something or someone getting killed or dying in almost every scene was a little much. I must say it was full of action because of that, but after about the second scene I knew something or someone was going to die in the next scene. I like to be surprised by the next scene, not know what is going to happen before it does.I thought all the acting was very well done, with Zellweger the best. She deserved the credit she got for it. I thought she played the part of the hillbilly girl very well. She must have done her homework on the part. Zellweger even said in the movie that she was smarter than people thought she was. I think that was true. Law did well with his part with all he had to go through to get back to Kidman. It must have been a lot stronger love to go through all that than I thought it was. Now he showed a lot of emotion in his face during his trials. Kidman's part may have had something to do with the fact I chose her performance after the other two. Except when she was depressed she didn't show much emotion, I don't know if that is how the part was written or if that is how she perceived the part. She still did a good job, I just thought the other two were better. I liked the scene with the Zellweger, Kidman and the rooster, even though it was one of those scenes I mentioned above. I thought the 'Home Guard' was exactly as they probably were back then. Even though we don't hear much about them they were a part of that time. I thought the scenery was beautiful. The movie had everything needed to be a good historical romance.",sadness
"I really hated this film. There. BOOM. Got it off my chest. It all starts so promisingly, with a scene of Anna Kendrick (""The Accountant"", who can be a very good actress) rejecting a wedding invitation; then accepting it; then burning it; then blowing it out; then posting it. I laughed. This was a rarity. There are about five more smile-worthy moments in the movie, most of which are delivered by Stephen Merchant.Anna plays Eloise who was SUPPOSED to be maid-of-honour at her best friend's wedding, but then broke up - messily - with her brother (the best man). She stubbornly attends the wedding in a posh hotel and finds herself on ""Table 19"" - a socially unfavourable location, full of a bunch of misfits that everyone expected to say ""no"" but didn't; a molly-coddled and awkward teen (Tony Revolori, ""Spider-man: Homecoming"") with the single goal of getting laid; ""The Kepps"" - a bickering married couple (Lisa Kudrow (""The Girl on the Train"", ""Friends"") and Craig Robinson (""Hot Tub Time Machine"")); a convicted fraudster serving his sentence in an open prison ( Stephen Merchant, ""Logan"") and a druggie former nanny of the bride (June Squibb, ""In and Out"").The fundamental problem with the movie is that Jeffrey Blitz's script (he also directs) is not only not very funny, but it is so fundamentally focused on the greedy and needy nature of the table's American reprobates that at every turn it leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Their motives are all utterly selfish and there's an ""if we get away with it, then that's fine"" attitude that pervades the plot.The nadir for me happens when - after trashing (albeit accidentally) a key part of the wedding they are attending, they cover their selfish backsides by (deliberately) trashing the same key part of another wedding going on in the same hotel.This is kind of positioned as a ""revenge"" sort of thing, but (in analysis) no wrong seems to have actually been done: its just another misunderstanding of the self-obsessed Eloise.The Kepp's story is also sad and selfish rather than comedic, and the resolution of this (and in fact all of the other sub-stories) for a nicely gift-wrapped ending is just saccharine and vomit-inducing. This is a wedding present that should have come with a label in big red writing:  ""DO NOT OPEN"".(For the graphical version please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

"I have to admit, I didn't walk into the theater with high hopes. All the talk about it not being close to the book creep-ed me out and I braced myself for disappointment. But it didn't come. The movie did have some down points that could have been avoided, but that wasn't enough to make it bad.Hugh Dancy's acting was great, and he was unbelievably cute in the movie. Agnes Bruckner was not much to watch. She didn't really bring anything special to the screen, and her acting was very robotic. The rest of the cast was awesome.I think the best part about the movie was the Cinematography. I really enjoyed the effects and the camera movements were highly skilled and a joy to watch.Now the bad part. For all the people out there that have read the book(which includes me) and liked it, you could be in for a wild ride. They made drastic changes to major parts of the book, one would be the removment of Vivians Mother, Esme, which through the movie off balance for a bit. It does, however, pick up the pieces and comes off with a very interesting story instead.One other thing I didn't fancy about the movie was Rafe and the Five. The fact that they ended up to be Vivians cousins, or at least Rafe, which takes away another good story found in the book. Gabriel certainly isn't like his character in the book and that really saddened me. Out of all the characters, he was very one dimensional.Now, the movie is nothing like the book except for a few major details and the producers added there own twist to them. If you ask me, lots of the changes were un-called for, but you just have to look past them. If you put the book out of your mind when you go to see it and try not to compare (which ended up to be very easy since the movie is so different you can't even tell it was based on the book) then I think you will enjoy this. You have to to try to like it for what it is and not hate it for what it should be. Oh, and don't bring you little kitties to this. There are a few gore scenes(not to explicit but enough) and some mature content. I wouldn't have categorized it as horror, but it does have a certain atmosphere that gives you the chills. I highly recommend this movie for it is the best werewolf movie you will probably ever run into. I rate it 9/10, and that is only because it is not enough like the book that is should be.",sadness

"Room stars Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay. It offers Larson her best performance of her career and Tremblay a break out role. While he may not quite get past the whole ""kid actor"" stereotype he is admittedly better than almost every other child actor out there today. Both of these actors are receiving some serious awards buzz right now, as is this film in general. This may be due to the odd nature of its plot line. A mother and child are stuck inside a room for at least five years of their lives. Trapped inside never once going out to see or experience the world. So, when they get out we watch as this child gets to see everything for the first time.Yes it's an interesting plot that hasn't really been done before but it can't really pull it off. It's odd that it struggles so bad with making this a worthy adaption of the book seeing as the author actually wrote the film. Much like last years 'Gone Girl'. However 'Gone Girl' actually had a good director.The one other film this director had done was 'Frank'. So I had high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, he may have proved to us that he is a one hit wonder. Because this film is not near as good as everyone is saying. This mainly steams from sloppy writing. Writing that would've probably worked in a book format. In that format you are able to show characters thoughts and feelings far easier than in film so you have to write accordingly.But this doesn't happen. This is really the only reason this film fails. But it fails hard. From the first scenes of the film it was pretty clear that not enough thought went into making this a piece of cinema. Characters actions and reactions to everything feel absurdly artificial. Like a cop figuring out where the room they lived in was from one extremely vague sentence. Or how the film seems to pretend like these two had never made one single escape attempt.Literally the second escape they try gets them out. I couldn't help think that they had never actually tried, because the guy didn't even hesitate to buy into their trick. In fact not one person in this film reacts naturally. Everyone was an extreme version of a normal person and it made nearly everyone in the film super unlikable. Especially the main two characters. They did virtually nothing aside from scream at whoever they wanted for no apparent reason. Almost every conversation ended in an annoying screaming match between random people. A screaming match that either made no sense or just made you dislike the characters. So, when these two get out it's hard to legitimately care about them. You don't know anything about them other then the fact that they liked yelling for no reason.'Room' may have strong performances and an interesting idea to back it up but not much else. It has a hard time making you actually care about its characters. No one reacts like a human being but instead yells at each other when ever they feel like they need to. It wastes its best qualities with a limp and lifeless script that fails to appropriately adapt the acclaimed novel.",sadness

"and that's saying a lot since I'm not a ""romantic comedy"" kind of gal.The little girl is fabulous. Good casting. She's adorable without being perfect. Kevin Kline was an absolute delight as an unapologetic drunken writer/professor who also happens to be quite full of himself. Rachel Weisz (whom I normally do not care for) was completely (and unexpectedly) charming. Ryan Reynolds was also a good casting choice. Unexpectedly believable as a dad.The bulk of the movie is him explaining to his daughter, bedtime story style (told entirely in flashbacks) about love and how he met her mother, with her being the proverbial ""happy ending"". Except ... she seems to be the only one who notices that her Dad really isn't happy at all. Isla Fisher also shines. Watching her character grow from someone who is completely devoid of any direction or purpose into a real woman, complete with self-esteem, was a nice touch.loved the relationship stories. It's amazing what you don't see when you are in a relationship, only to come to a realization much later. Anyone who has ever traded a trip on the QEII for a proverbial three hour tour on the S.S. Minnow relationship-wise will totally relate.The fact that Ryan Reynolds sometimes gets so carried away with the story that he forgets he is talking to a little girl leads to a few (ok, so it's a lot) contrived chuckles along with a couple of genuinely funny moments.It's not going to win an Oscar or break a box office record, but if you want a completely enjoyable two hour escape ... see this movie.",sadness
"People who rate this movie anything lower than 5 are obviously not taking their review seriously. They might not like the film personally, but that shouldn't generate a biased low score. Unlike a lot of other horror movies, this one actually had a backstory as to the origins and reasoning for the game--I was surprised with that. I expected it to just be a scary game with no purpose, but I genuinely respect that they added a backstory. 
Next, this movie is overall just unique and cool. Unlike other cliche horror films where some demon figure is ""haunting"" the house, this film takes a unique approach by having a group of friends end up being the ones that have to do the ""haunting"" and ""killing""; this concept also played well on friendship and family bonds/truth telling and trusting one another. 
Lastly, the creepy smiles make for iconic visuals that will stick with you even after you finish watching.",sadness
"What makes me sad about Bride Wars is the fact that it's going to make a lot of money on its opening weekend, and probably double or triple that amount throughout its run. Why anyone would want to submit himself to an over-clichéd chick flick that looks and acts like something we've all seen a million times before - only worse - is beyond me. Still, awareness seems to be sky high, with many unwilling boyfriends/husbands destined to be dragged to their local theaters by their mates.At a time where quality films like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Slumdog Millionaire are actually making a dent at the box-office, Bride Wars existence baffles me. The story follows two BFF (best friends forever) who decided to have a wedding in June at some fancy plaza when they were little girls. Years later, an unfortunate series of events ends in both the women - still BFF well into their twenties (like duh) - setting their wedding day on the exact same date. From here on out, it's war between the two stereotypical women (one control-freaked blonde, otherwise known as Kate Hudson; and one spineless brunette, known better as Anne Hathaway). Naturally, both ladies live in a perfect world where there's no economic depression and they can each spend an enormous amount of money on this unnecessary war of theirs. Alas, instead of being a decent display of romantic comedy, Bride Wars becomes a shallow and degrading show that implies that with all the progress the feminist movement has made during the past century, women will always be emotional and helpless beings, forever interested in superficial matters. In a time when women aim to run for Presidency and lead social revolutions, this is a real depressing conclusion. Add this to the aforementioned fact that Bride Wars utilizes every cliché in the book, and you're better off watching one of the numerous Oscar hopefuls heading your way.I gave it 4 out of 10.",sadness

"This is probably the quietest and most understated post-apocalyptic movies you'll ever see, but deep down, it is truly fascinating. With great performances, impressive directing and an intriguing plot, this film is massively engrossing and surprisingly simple to understand from start to finish.First things first, however, this isn't a sci-fi in any way. The setting is in the post-apocalypse world, however that bears pretty much no relevance to the development of the plot as a whole, it's just a background to put these three characters together in a more desperate and dramatic situation.Instead, this is more of an indie romantic drama, so be warned, sci- fi fans, there's nothing here for you if you're just looking for something exciting and action-packed.What this actually is is a fascinating study of humans in their most basic state: survival and animalistic desires, relating itself almost to Adam and Eve and biblical theory.Therefore, the most captivating part of this film is the relationships that develop between the three main characters, as each of the men gets closer to Margot Robbie's character, tensions begin to rise and a clash becomes inevitable, however watching these people act in such a basic way, driven by their pure desire for procreation, is hugely fascinating throughout, and at times even thrilling.What really helps that to be so is the performances. Margot Robbie, in the female lead, is okay. It's not a stunning performance in any way, but her character isn't really the most interesting, as apart from her devout Christianity, she's only really there to set the spark off between the two men.As a result, it's Chiwetel Ejiofor and Chris Pine that are most impressive. Pine plays a slightly smaller role, but successfully asserts his position within the trio and causes huge complications that turn Chiwetel Ejiofor's character into the most interesting. Ejiofor's performance perfectly conveys his character's natural frustration and desperation in this situation, and that makes him absolutely brilliant to watch.Finally, something's got to be said about the directing here. Instead of fitting in in a long line of post-apocalyptic movies, this film, thanks to director Craig Zobel, doesn't feel cold and as if there is some intense impending danger, but the lush nature of the landscape that the film is shot against and the clear serenity of the environment makes this a much warmer and calmer film that makes it all the more pleasant and engaging to watch.",sadness

"Just finished watching the movie in an advanced screening, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The entire movie had the audience in stitches, and for good reason — it's really, really funny. In a very overt way.Jason Segel is cute, lovable and hilarious as Tom. He's a man who ends up in a small town even though he's clearly built for the city. His fiancé, Violet, on the other hand, is more than thrilled to enjoy post-doc life in Michigan. They're an unusual, quirky couple who go to parties dressed as Princess Diana and Super-Bunnie. It's hard not to feel bad for Tom when he ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time, jobless and poor. Working at a sandwich store barely competes with the Head Chef position he could have had, had he not moved to Ann Arbor with Violet.Emily Blunt — you've been sent to us from heaven. The actress brings a breath of fresh air with every role she undertakes. She's funny, she's sarcastic, she's adorable. You'll come out loving both the characters with a passion. Because you get them. They're weird, just like normal people. They have their quirks, they don't talk enough, and they have serious issues that they treat in funny ways just to make them less relevant. I do that all the time!The story is not groundbreaking. Mid-way through the movie, you can tell exactly what's going to happen next. But you keep watching because you know there's a ridiculous joke around the corner. Writer and director Nick Stroller clearly learned a thing or two from his mentor, Judd Apatow. This movie is fresh and funny, despite the stale storyline. And the two lead actors do it the utmost justice.",sadness

"One of the funniest films in years, this crude and politically incorrect comedy was funny from the get-go thru the final credits. Never taking the plot too seriously, the film avoids necessary predictability, taking great advantage of the loose set-up to pile on the laughs throughout. I wasn't familiar with most of the cast, but whoever they were they delivered the laughs. This was the rare movie that didn't seem too long (cf.

"The early death of River Phoenix has given his films a posthumous lustre; but 'Stand By Me', though not without merits, is not a great film.  It gets some things right: for example, it has the courage to tell a tale of four decidedly pre-pubescent children, and while they do not necessarily make pleasant company, its a relief to see a ""rights of passage"" film not entirely shaped by a story of first love.  But the characters are disappointly archetypal: the sensitive writer, the wise gang leader, the stupid fat kid and the wild one; and the dialogue and story are at times weighed down by the burden of implied significance.  Also hard to understand is why the older boys who also appear should be quite so wound up by the film's (much younger) heroes.  The low key ending is also undermined by the sentimental wrapping provided by the narrator.  Read Roddy Doyle's novel 'Paddy Clarke Ha-ha-ha' for a less heavy handed story of children growing up by stealth.",sadness

Everyone walks around in a bit of a stupor, emotionally stunted and not really connecting with each other. It is slow and boring, and I never developed any emotional connection with any of the characters. I simply did not care what happened to them. Everyone gets their moment when they speechify to a (usually younger) character about life, love and the meaning of the universe. I really hate that kind of ""set-speech"" moment. It's like a glaring spotlight on the character, that is unnatural and annoying. Then again, I didn't like ""Diner"" either.

"This film was groundbreaking in the sense that it dealt with sexual harassment in the workplace in a way that was quite realistic for 1960. All the women are in menial jobs at the insurance company where Jack Lemmon's character works, and all of the executives are men. The executives look at their female workforce as one big harem and won't let a little thing like the fact that they are married and intend to stay that way interfere with their stepping out from time to time. This is where C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) comes in. He trades the use of his apartment to these executives in return for promotions and perks. However, Baxter has an attack of conscience when he comes face-to-face with the collateral damage that one of these executives is doing in the person of Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine). Fran, the elevator operator, has just found out she is one of many affairs for big boss Mr. Sheldrake (Fred McMurray), whom she genuinely loves, and when she and Sheldrake quarrel in Baxter's apartment and Sheldrake leaves her some money for her troubles, unintentionally making her feel even cheaper than she already feels she swallows a bottle of sleeping pills hoping not to wake up, slipping into a coma on Baxter's bed.Things I noticed - this film has lost something with the passage of time in the shock value that was, I think, part of the original appeal. But it still has some outstanding acting, some personal redemption and transformation that people just love to see on film, and kudos to Mr. McMurray for portraying an authentic heel, leading women on and leading a double life without a tinge of conscience, phoning to inquire about his mistress' health on Christmas Day as he is busy playing with his children at home. Without this entry under his belt I would have always doubted his range as he was the perennial nice guy in almost every other role he ever had.Did you also notice a business world and a New York that is gone forever? Nobody adds numbers by hand - or by computer for that matter - any more, elevators have long been run by machines, and the entire floor of people that Baxter worked on would today be replaced by computers. Also notice that Baxter has a very middling job - at least at first - and yet lives comfortably sans roommate to share expenses in an apartment IN Manhattan. Those were the days.",sadness
"It's funny how Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, two of Hollywood's most powerful men, who could literally do any movie they want, end up making something like The Terminal. Instead of reaching for new heights of film-making like including the latest in special effects, or new original ways of storytelling and editing, Spielberg goes back to a simpler form. That in itself is surprisingly refreshing. Filmmakers try so hard to be inventive and change the typical form of the classics, that when someone finally does go back to that Capra or Wilder fashion, it ends up seeming original. That's what The Terminal goes for. A movie about characters, not plot. About emotion, not CGI. It's a true heart-felt piece of work. It's funny, it's cute, and it always keeps you interested.Tom Hanks leads an exceptional cast as Viktor Navorski, a man stranded in JFK airport, not welcome in the U.S. and having no country to come home to. Throughout the experience he makes friends, a love interest, and a rival. He changes all of their lives, of course. That's to be expected from a movie like this. Tom Hanks is totally believable, accent and all. It's a performance well worthy of an Oscar nod.I loved The Terminal for many reasons, but one big reason is it's simplicity. And more importantly, because it is good at being simple. It doesn't contribute anything new to movies, it doesn't try to. It is what it is. A great, feel-good film. Something that is getting rarer and rarer these days. Sometimes you'll want to see a gritty, wrenching melodrama, but other times you'll want to see The Terminal.My rating: 10/10",sadness

Yeah totally agree that the plot summary is completed wrong the American woman just wants to know a little history of the place and the previous owner but anyways I saw a advanced screening in Melbourne at the jam factory - won free tickets thanks to me being a member of the Australian film institute- and wasn't excepting much but it was all harmless fun with some funny moments. Its more of a adult type comedy and people below 24 or so will probably not like this movie at all and no one is in danger of winning a Oscar here but its just a laid back movie.

"This is a movie that I think was publicized incorrectly and yet I know when my companion and I went we liked it even though a lot of clichés were evident...the twist at the end was so telegraphed it was not and suspense though the acting of Aaron Eckhardt was very good, Martin Sheen also shone brightly ..Jennifer Aniston was serviceable though she seems to play a variant of the same character in every movie...Not a classic by any means but not a dreck i would say 2.5/5 and it was a nice date movie but no new territory explored that has not been done before...But it is not bad to see and like i said before the acting of Aaron Eckhardt and Martin Sheen raise the level of this movie with spirited performances.",sadness

"Over the last few years martial arts films have been making more of a comeback. Sadly most of them just aren't all that great. The upside is if they can deliver on the fighting then you can look past everything else. The Girl From The Naked Eye takes on the martial arts genre, while sporting a comic promotional look and an appearance by ex-adult film star Sasha Grey. Will it be one of those surprise gems that deliver the needed action or will it be an immediate knockout? The Girl From The Naked Eye follows a man who will stop at nothing to track down the killer of the escort he was assigned to protect. This movie looked and felt like it had some good potential. All this was put to rest once the film got going. The story was all over the place and led by some really poor acting. Sasha Grey has established herself as a pretty decent actress with roles such as Entourage, but here is pretty much just a selling point for promotion since she barely even shows up. Yeah it had some decent fight sequences that are entertaining, but not enough to really help this movie work like it wanted to. There are some recognizable martial arts guys showing up to fight here and there, which makes it that much more of a disappointment when they fights don't always work. When you finally get to some of the better action and the movie seems to be finally be going somewhere, it takes a strange turn and just kind of ends. The ending made little to no sense, but this may have something to do with the slow paced story that was all over the place early on.This was a movie that should have worked but just does not. If you are of the mindset of watching martial arts films just for the fighting, there are so many others that are a much better option. Enjoy anyone in this film or not, do not let the eye catching cover art suck you in that is the best part of the movie.http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey",sadness

This is definitely a love letter to horror fans, the ones who are gore to the core.Maybe the humor was a little off. I thought the sex factor was played up a bit more than it ought to have been (but I am also very prudish).

"I mean - I'm a fairly harsh critic and I hate most every gay movie that comes out (I'm gay BTW) and I was poised for this one to annoy the crap out of me. But it started and I'll tell you - I was wiping away the tears (from laughter) from pretty much the opening sequence. The four men they found for the four leads were astoundingly, shamelessly gleeful in their complicated renderings of these boys - they didn't phone anything in - even the gratuitous (I'm a littly prudish, I guess) flatulation sequence was imbued with a sincerity and a sweetness that was welcome and unexpectedly necessary and it made it actually, genuinely funny. That doesn't happen often with flatulation jokes for me. And I think that description defines the entire film for me - it was unexpectedly inspired and made me laugh when I wouldn't have typically. And I cried, too - for the sweetness of one story line. I usually feel manipulated and ridiculous after a romantic comedy but something happens in this film that brings it home - I wasn't angry and I wanted it to go on and on and on. As a gay film buff I guess it was hugely satisfying to see the same stupid movie I've seen seven thousand times about straight people remade - and reconsidered - and turned into something that I could claim as my own. I got it - and I don't usually get to get it. It's a special hour and a half - I hope everyone gets to see it.",sadness

If after seeing the cover, Stallone with sunglasses an Uzi in his hand and a match in his mouth, and you still rented this and hated it you deserve what you get. If you want to watch ""Masterpiece Theater"" and pretend not to be bored then go ahead. Leave action movies for the fans of the genre.This movie doesn't pretend to be anything that it's not. It's a violent, campy, 80's Stallone vehicle that is a lot of fun. Cobra is a cool character with catchy one liners and an awesome 50 Merc Coup. He wears sunglasses and a match in his mouth. A rouge cop who works the zombie squad and is a lonely guy until he meets an aspiring model who he's been hired to protect. If you dont like Stallone then this film will not change you're mind.

"Straightforward' is not a word I will use in this review to describe Paul Thomas Anderson's newest film Inherent Vice. Lying somewhere at the crossroads between a '70s neo-noir film and an absurdist stoner comedy, this neon-tinged detective story is two-and-a-half hours of increasingly absurd psychedelic mayhem. It's dense, confusing, chaotic, and absolutely riveting in its amorphous plotting and paranoid atmosphere.Musician Joanna Newsom plays Sortilège, the film's narrator and our guide through the hazy story of hippie-turned-private-detective Doc Sportello (Joaquin Phoenix). The story starts off simply enough, with Doc hired by his ex-girlfriend Shasta (Katherine Waterston) to locate her missing lover, but it all quickly spirals out of control into nearly a dozen different sub-plots featuring neo-Nazis, real estate, dentistry and everything in between.As the first filmmaker to adapt a Thomas Pynchon novel to the screen, there was a great deal of pressure on Paul Thomas Anderson to successfully translate the source novel's complex prose into a relatively understandable film. Pynchon's work is known for featuring dozens upon dozens of characters involved in a variety of loosely connected plot lines, which makes it nearly impossible to faithfully adapt his novels. Of course, anyone who has seen Anderson's epic ensemble drama Magnolia can confirm that the director is more than capable of seamlessly interweaving countless characters and story lines, and in the case of Inherent Vice Anderson truly does an astounding job of packing so much dense material into a feature-length film. Although the plot is hardly comprehensible upon the first viewing, a second or third viewing reveals that, while intensely complex, the story is entirely coherent thanks to Anderson's clever, brilliantly- crafted script.That comparison to Magnolia may be misleading, however, as Inherent Vice occupies a unique place in Paul Thomas Anderson's filmography. While Anderson has dabbled in comedy in the past, most notably with his dark rom-com Punch-Drunk love, his humor has always been a cover for the far more deeply rooted melancholy that permeates all his films. While Inherent Vice's humor does take a backseat to the film's central mystery, it's nonetheless far brasher than that of any other PTA film. Anderson himself compared the film's comic timing to that of '80s screwball comedies Airplane! and The Naked Gun, a comparison that is uncharacteristic of his typical style to say the least. While it's surely more a neo-noir than a comedy, the film has more than enough laugh-out-loud moments to make it PTA's funniest movie to date, as well as a unique next step in his evolution as a director.While Anderson's script does deserve its fair share of credit for the film's absurd humor, what really makes Inherent Vice so funny is the acting, especially that of Joaquin Phoenix and Josh Brolin. Phoenix's portrayal of our perpetually stoned protagonist Doc is universally spot-on; with a wonderfully out-of-it expression frozen on his face, Doc stumbles through the movie dazed and confused in a marijuana-induced haze. The smallest details, such as Doc aggressively slapping himself in the face mid-conversation to focus, are what make his performance so consistently enjoyable. Brolin, meanwhile, steals the show as hippie-hating cop Christian ""Bigfoot"" Björnsen, who both antagonizes and collaborates with Doc to unravel the film's tangled web of mysteries. Bigfooot's many idiosyncrasies, including the inadvertently suggestive way he eats frozen bananas and his not-quite-mastery of Japanese, make him by far one of the funniest and most colorful characters of the film, and Josh Brolin plays him with just the right mix of hotheadedness and cluelessness.Despite Inherent Vice's one-of-a-kind style and atmosphere, it's still ultimately not going to work for a whole lot of people. It's virtually impossible to follow the plot the first time around, and its many subplots and manic storytelling style will surely frustrate and alienate many viewers. For those that can tolerate its eccentricities however, it's a rambling drug-fueled odyssey worth taking and, while it may not be his best work, yet another impressive showcase of Paul Thomas Anderson's incredible talent and versatility as a filmmaker.",sadness
"This is the best acting performance I've ever seen William Fichtner do. And let me say first, this film is not what I was expecting- but I loved it. It's marketed as a thriller, but it's definitely more of a slow burn drama about a man who is unhappy with his life and becomes infatuated/obsessed with his young female neighbor who has her own problems. Never seen this actress before but wow, she's incredible. And somehow Michael Rosenbaum's character is both vile and charming simultaneously. Highly recommend watching this as a fantastic piece of film, acting, characters, and storyline. Just don't go in thinking it's some crazy thriller movie.",sadness
"Meh. The film starts with a delightfully surreal premise, and gets off to a promising start as a Strangelovesque dark comedy, or perhaps even a ""Being John Malkovich"" maze of mind-boggling left turns.The moments of humor, however, thin out. The plot hews to the obvious even in its twists. The deadpan delivery becomes merely dead, and a sea of intolerably flat affect gradually crushes any empathy we might have for the characters. Exhausted of its premise, disinterested in both the humans who inhabit it and the humans who are watching it, and groping for any sort of social observation that is not already obvious and well-trodden, the film finds it has little left to say and another 90 minutes to say it.It drags itself, sallow and lifeless, to a cliffhanger conclusion that leaves us wondering what happens next, but not really caring.",sadness
"But the movie is only so-so. Yeah, it's a good weekend movie to be seen at home, but it did not impress me much.What did impress me is Harrison Ford's acting (that's why I gave it an 8). This guy is really good and his emotions were masterfully sent through the screen to the viewer (in this case me). I did not expect that...I am not a fan of his work, but this is the best acting performance of 2015 for me. Sir, you have my respect!Also the cinematic capture is discreet, but also extremely well put together.",sadness
"Acclaimed Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan's The Captive (2014) is a strange mess that leaves one high and dry and utterly frustrated. It shows promise to begin with but ultimately gets lost in the vacuum created by Egoyan's over-ambitious, almost ludicrous storytelling and below par execution - a clear case of a gifted filmmaker undone by his own lack of judgment, clarity, and poor selection. In fact, the best way to describe ""The Captive"" would be as a futile exercise in wishful filmmaking.What hurts most is that the movie's plot in itself is quite plausible. It revolves around a young girl who is abducted by a pedophile, with the police and parents trying their best to locate her but with little luck. The theme harks back to Sean Penn's ""The Pledge"" but the maturity in execution that Penn's film had is clearly missing here. Barring some decent acting that's on display, courtesy of Ryan Reynolds, Rosario Dawson (smoking hot as ever) and the rest of the cast, the movie has nothing much to offer except for loads of drivel and foolish fancies spun by a motley of muddle headed individuals, seemingly carried away by the burden of their own genius.For more, please visit my film blogsite:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",sadness

He calls in his friend Laszlo (an uproarious performance by Danny DeVito) to help out and also has to deal with his jealous girlfriend and her disapproving mother.The comedy is really well-done with numerous set pieces involving a food fight, a wacky car chase, and a showdown at a hospital involving a slew of crooks wanting Danza's inheritance. I think of this as a old-fashioned Disney comedy, but with adult language/humor present. Sadly no DVD or Blu-ray release due to music rights issues.",sadness
"I have watched Edward Scissorhands ever since I was a little girl, this movie has always held a very special place in my heart. I think because I could relate to Edward no, I don't have scissors for hands, but what I mean is that this is a fairytale story, but this is a simple story of a man who just wants to fit into a society of ""norms"". This is completely Tim Burton's creation and story, he's a very criticized director, he's either loved or hated. Some consider his stories to be too dark and strange, but when you get inside his head, you realize this is a man who is pure genius. He thinks completely outside the box and doesn't just resort to what Hollywood wants, he knows his audience and doesn't insult their intelligence, he brings us a charming story about Edward Scissorhands.An elderly woman tells a story to her granddaughter of a man with scissors for hands named Edward, the creation of an inventor. He raised Edward as his son and tutored him in various subjects, but died while in the act of offering a pair of hands to Edward. Many years later, local Avon saleswoman Peg Boggs, after failing to make profits in her suburban neighborhood, visits a Gothic mansion on a hill. There, she finds Edward, and convinces him to have her take him in. Edward befriends Peg's young son, Kevin and her teenage daughter Kim. Peg's neighbors become curious and thrilled at Edward's masterful skills at hedge clipping and haircutting. However Kim's jock boyfriend Jim dislikes Edward immediately. Edward's innocence becomes an easy target for everyone to take advantage of him as often as they can. Wither it's destroying his reputation or putting him in danger, Edward was never prepared for this harsh world when he was given the kindest heart.From the acting, Johnny Depp's first real leading role in a movie, he's so young and so incredibly talented. He plays Edward with perfect sympathy not over or under acting it, to be honest I'm a little surprised he wasn't nominated for an Oscar, but it's such a bizarre role, I think it was very over looked. He makes Edward into a charming beautiful character that you fall in love with. Dianne Wiest, one of my favorite actress as the Avon lady, Peg, who takes Edward home with her, the reason I love her so much is she brings so much class into whatever role she is playing. She seems like the most lovely woman you could meet and makes Peg into a delightful woman who just wanted to help this man and didn't realize the world she brought him into. Winona Ryder, who was dating Depp at the time, had great chemistry and was absolutely beautiful. To the sets, which this world was just bizarre and stands out against so many other movies, like a strange Leave it to Beaver nightmare, all the houses in the suburbia are different pastel colors to this one hill with a dark castle. To the outstanding make up effects, can only imagine the pain it took to get in and out of that costume for Edward. Edward Scissorhands is truly a masterpiece and in my opinion will always remain a treasured classic, because all in all this is one of the most beautiful movies of all time.10/10",sadness

City Lights is simply put one of the best movies out there. Every scene is classic and had a huge impact on the history of film-making. Chaplin's last 'silent' film tells the story of a poor little man the tramp played by Chaplin who falls in love with a blind flower girl. He becomes friends with a wealthy man who constantly tries to commit suicide. The man only recognizes the tramp character when he is drunk. To impress the flower girl the tramp uses the man's wealth to make her fall in love with him. The only problem is that when the man is sober he doesn't recognize the tramp anymore. On top of this the flower girl has to pay 22 dollars of rent or she will be thrown out of her apartment. Now the tramp desperately seeks for jobs in the city to help his love. Out of this simple plot great comedy and heart breaking moments come forth.The outcome of the movie is to almost all people known. It is regarded as one of the best endings ever taped on film. The movie itself still is masterpiece more than 70 years after it's release. I personally rate this as Chaplin's second best I have seen so far. My favorite remains The Gold Rush. Still this movie gets 5/5 stars from me.,sadness

"I am writing this after watching Mr Jones. I don't write many reviews, only about a dozen in a few years and only when something really interests me. Mr Jones falls into this category.To begin with I found the introduction a little thin. A guy wants to create a nature documentary so uproots his life and with his girlfriend they go into some rural wilderness. So lets assume that they have the money to do this.... then what? There is no mention of a pending deal with a film distributer, and from what I can tell the 'wilderness' is not really wild; there is hardly anything that warrants a nature doco. And his girlfriend Penny is really going to put of her photography dreams for this!? As I said, thin.We learn that the Scott is on 'meds' which he decides he doesn't want to take while out there, which causes him to become sullen and lazy, and his documentary falters.... until one day whilst filming some one dressed in what looks like black robes takes his bag and runs off. Does Scott chase him? Sure, but he has to get his girlfriend first! Together they break into the house of this person who after looking at some of his 'art' Penny identifies (without a doubt) that the person is the infamous and illusive Mr Jones, an mysterious artist from the 70's who created dozens of pieces and mails them to different people around the world.Of course Scott believes her and takes off for NYC to interview a number of people with some knowledge of Mr Jones. Must be great being rich! Of course he leaves Penny there alone. I know I would knowing there is a strange man wondering around who makes strange 'art' and has already stolen from them, and knows they were in his basement.From here the movie turns. The best way to describe it would be to possess the body of some one having an acid trip. Though experiences and those of others it is expressed that the art are Totems or Talismans and for some reason the characters who are sent the art start experiencing bizarre images and dreams. Wont say more as it would give away to much. The best comparison would be yellowbrickroad.Premise aside the movie is quiet decent. The character of Penny is much easier to watch and care for then Scott who comes across as a pretentious selfish prat. The tone and atmosphere presented is very successful and I was brought into the movie. The overall direction is convoluted and a straight out film may have worked better then the handycam nonsense that hasn't worked for me since the The Last Exorcist (though Paranormal Activity 5 is a guilty pleasure). Overall I give this film a 6.",sadness
"One thing you can say about The Perfect Holiday is that it's slightly less idiotic than most of the recent crop of holiday movies. It doesn't suffer from the same juvenile slapstick bits as Deck The Halls, Surviving Christmas, or Christmas With The Kranks. Furthermore, it's nice to see people of color getting a story they can call their own, while all of those other titles (forgettable as they may be) depict Christmas as something that exists entirely in a white-bread suburban world. It's a shame that this movie isn't more original. It's filled with talented actors, but the script is at the level of a TV sitcom holiday special. Morris Chestnut and Gabrielle Union do they best they can with their cookie-cutter parts, but the audience knows from Minute One exactly where the jokes are going.",sadness
"Never Let Me Go is based upon the novel of the same name by Kazuo Ishiguro. The film follows three friends named Kathy, Tommy and Ruth while they are at an English boarding school and continues to follow them now as adults. I think the less I can say in my synopsis of this film would be for the better. I really do not want to spoil anything and I think the film would be more powerful and meaningful to one who maybe does not know all that much about it and goes into the theatre with an open mind, so for that reason I am no longer going to talk about the story aspect of the film. However if you have read the very popular novel that the film is based on, you should know what you are in for. How closely the film follows the book I can not say having not read it, or any other novels by Kazuo Ishiguro. I personally found the film to be quite powerful and at times quite poetic and even beautiful. More than anything else the main point to this film is the love story that is featured in the film and so much of the rest of it kind of focuses around that. These three characters we are introduced to are all a bit different in their personality traits, but with good character study we soon get to know more about them and see them put in difficult situations and how they grasp said situations and how they deal with them. The relationships between the three are believable and in a lot of ways there is still so much innocence to them, even later as they become adults, but in other ways they are very mature and ready to make way for themselves in the world. The love these characters have for each other and the memories of how they grew up together and everything they have experienced together is thoughtful in a way that it is like most of our youth days at school, or with our school or classmates back however long that may take us. We also remember that when we were at school there was always someone we thought we loved and whether it grew into something, or not, we still remember it and we also remember qualities and things about the schools we went to and the other people there, whether they were good memories, or perhaps not. As a young adult we can relate to trying to find ourselves in the world and making a name for ourselves. Often there is barriers though and things we have to overcome to achieve this. Through all of this though, we still remember the people who were with us and helped us to get through it and so do the three characters in Never Let Me Go. Because the film captures a certain nostalgic point of childhood and of our loves and friendships, it does so in a way that is beautiful because it shows us what is truly important in life and that whatever may have happened in the past has helped us to grow physically and mentally and to prepare for the life ahead of us. These characters do that and although their situations are slightly different, I think this film will bring back nostalgia for the viewers watching it and we can smile, or even cry at our own memories, but being able to do that, helps us to relate to these characters even more. The character study although subtle and done at a more leisurely pace is still really revealing and well done. The story is fascinating and powerfully done and will leave you thinking about what you saw long after the film is over. The cinematography of the film is gorgeous and always a pleasure to look at and the young actors who play Kathy, Tommy and Ruth all do a very fine job here. The screenplay is right on the mark with where it wants to take us and show us and it succeeds very well with that as well as the almost dreamlike and meditative state of the film's direction which adds to the more poetic and beautiful parts of the film. I think this is a film to see more than once to truly appreciate it, but on first viewing it is still great as well.",sadness
"in most movies, the girl wants to be famous in Hollywood and making millions. in this she just wants to be a flight attendant. its nice to see that and thats why i liked the movie so much. Gwyneth Paltrow was so good in this movie and had a great innocent charm to her. she just wanted to get out of her small dumpy town. the supporting cast was good as well, especially kelly preston who tells Gwyneths character about the top flight attendant company or whatever. Christina applegate, candice bergin and mark ruffolo are good as well and a great cameo from rob lowe. my only small problem with this movie was mike myers. he was funny as first then the whole eye joke got over the top and kinda stupid but none the less he was funny for a minute or so. view from the top is typical and u know whats gonna happen at the end, sort of. you know that shes gonna be happy in the end with her man but in this movie, the heroine's big dreams are simple and thats why i loved this movie so much.",sadness

"Following last year's impressive performance in Martin Scorsese's critically-acclaimed Hugo (2011), British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen is back doing what he does best with yet another satirical caricature to add to his ever growing list. For his latest endeavor, The Dictator (2012), Cohen has once again reunited with director Larry Charles (Borat, Bruno), in a film that benefits much from an uncharacteristically straightforward narrative.The Dictator's narrative is a little bit more scripted than Cohen's previous efforts, which saw him interact with real people - often with hilarious results. In addition to the riches-to-rags story beat, there is also a Rom-com element to the film as Aladeen is helped along his journey of redemption by Zoey, which makes for some humorous moments.You needn't worry about it being too scripted though; Cohen's unique brand of offensive humor is on full display from the outset as sexist, racist, and vulgar gags abound. Saddled in-between are a number of outrageous, cringe-worthy sequences that have long been Cohen's trademark. These often occur with scientist turned partner-in-crime Nadal, and the chemistry between Cohen and Mantzoukas is evident.Admittedly, not all the jokes hit their mark - the celebrity cameos (including Megan Fox) don't have the intended impact, but the audience reaction is for the most part well-calculated. The hilarious usage of overblown music tracks such as Moment Like This is just one example of the excellent comedic timing which permeates The Dictator throughout.If you don't take Cohen's latest role too seriously, you may likely find Admiral General Aladeen to be another fantastic character to add to Cohen's catalogue. Assuming you're not easily offended, The Dictator is laugh-out-loud comedy at its best.",sadness

"I am from Taiwan. I watched this movie on July 29, 2006 in Taiwan. I cried real hard while watching the movie because it reminded me some of my most and beautiful memories. Nine years ago I was traveling in the US. Three weeks before I came back to Taiwan, I met a very nice young man who was only 19 going 20 years old very soon. I am sure we had strong affection for each other, but I was leaving soon, and I am a lot older than him--though I never told him how old I was. I didn't think it was possible for us to have a future because I wanted to settle down, and I don't think it was his time to do so. So I kept my affection for him as my secret, and never told him how I felt about him. After I came back to Taiwan, I tried to keep in touch with him, but somehow, we were just not meant to be. We were both busy and were moving around, so we lost contact for a while. Finally, about a month before his 21st birthday, we got back in touch. I was so happy then. We exchanged a few e-mails, and the last one I received from him was one week before his 21st birthday. The last thing I remembered was I said and did something silly which could have offended him on the phone, and I didn't get to explain it properly. So after his birthday, I never heard from him again. I thought that I offended him, that's why he never got back in touch with me again. I was sad, but to me, he was too good to be true anyway. So I didn't think too much of it, and just moved on with my life. At the end of May this year, I occasionally read the diary I had kept during the 3 weeks with him, and all my affection for him came back. I started to google him. After trying hard crazily for a month or so, I finally confirmed that he died on his 21st birthday. An instant heartache caught me upon hearing the news, and I can't believe that I didn't know about his death until 8 years later! I still hope that I had found the wrong guy who happened to have the same name.... After watching ""The Lake House,"" I also wrote him e-mails to warn him. Who knows, there are always mysterious things. What surprised me about the movie was it took place in Chicagowhere he was from. Although I know he wouldn't be able to receive my e-mail ""physically,"" I still write to him from time to time. And now I can finally tell him how I felt about him. I love this movie because in a way, my dream came true in the movie.",sadness

"Every true fan of the original Sleeping Beauty (1959) was skeptical about this and how much it had to deviate from the actual movie, and as more of the movie was revealed, it was only proving to be another female empowerment, victimized villain kind of a movie. But I'm glad I was wrong, for I'm sure only by watching the whole movie can we truly appreciate and understand the very convincing back story and development the character was subject to. Of course with very liberal changes to the original plot, the key elements that you'd look for are intact. Need I mention the perfect casting of Angelina Jolie, Maleficent truly comes to life in full form by Angelina's stunning skills and presence. A twist that's not cliché, sentiments that are deep, humor that's ever so natural and action that always keeps you at the edge of your seat! Maleficent in this movie is not exactly as we know of her from the few minutes we got to see her in the original movie, but let me tell you she's every bit deliciously evil. It was amusing to see Angelina play a role that requires a lot of nuances to pull of this character with a lot of depth as opposed to the one-dimensional character from the movie. Never letting off the grip, she carried the movie on her shoulders. Nothing to take away from the beauty of the rest of the movie which takes breath with excellent direction and visual effects that will truly transport you to another world, and the amazing work by all the 'supporting' actors. Yes, the other characters weren't as fleshed out as Maleficent, but I see that as good thing, given the title and theme. A spectacular balance. I'd also like to bring light on the enchanting score, thanks to James Newton Howard, this maestro is underrated.A comprehensive movie, there's a little something for audiences of all ages, truly a masterpiece.",sadness

"The great cast already hints at it, ""Fallen"" is a great movie.Best way to watch this movie is to not know too much about it. Just pick up the movie and let it surprise you. It's like ""Identity"", the less you know about it, the better.Director Gregory Hoblit is a great and underrated director. He knows how to get the maximum out of everything. He also directed the movies ""Primal fear"" and ""Frequency"" and much acclaimed television series episodes for ""Hill Street Blues"", ""L.A. Law"" and ""NYPD Blue"".Really great about the movie is the story by Nicholas Kazan (yes, indeed the son of...). It's supernatural but it still knows how to remain believable and realistic. The viewer never knows what he is going to get and what will happen next. This is why it is best not to know too much about this movie's story before viewing it for the first time.

i believe every movie deserves credit for trying. even though it didn't seem to be like the perfect movie in the entire world but however the production team and the director did what they could to make this movie work out. they got the cast from the originals back and almost everything. although it was a different director but i still give him credit for the work he put in for this movie and i give the credit to the rest of the team and the stars. it was very enjoyable. so thats why i give it a 10/10 because they tried everything to make the movie work. if they were to make another sequel my advice to them is to stick with whoever directs the original as the director instead of changing directors during sequels.,sadness

I'm surprised at the good cast. The extensive cast is not actually bad except for Schneider. By this point, he should come with a warning. Funny enough, he's probably the only true comedian of the bunch. Quite frankly, I can see this as an Adam Sandler movie with all of his gang. I have never heard of Rob Hedden. He seems to have been a Hollywood journeyman. The main issue is that non of this is actually funny. Annable and McPhee are not comedic powerhouses. At best, they're the straight men in a comedy. They need an actual comedian and Schneider is not close. Also I'm a little tired of Annable. This is not so bad that it becomes funny again. It's trying to be a fun silly comedy and it doesn't have that. On the other hand, Hawaii does look beautiful.",sadness

"First off, it's a love story only. Anyone hoping for a little bit of an interesting twist on the 'living forever' aspect will be disappointed. They didn't even try to make that part interesting. I don't even consider this a spoiler because it's so lame - it was just a random lightning strike. So she doesn't age....and in 70 years or so she just becomes preposterously intelligent and experienced in everything. So basically she's the 'perfect' woman....but she runs away from every relationship because she fears being 'found out'. The flatness of the character, combined with this story, failed to draw me in. It's fine that the movie was solely a love story. But it's overrated. My guess is that it will end-up at around a 6.2 rating when it's all said and done. When more people see it on rentals and stuff. It was okay. Everyone saying how great Harrison Ford was....he was alright, but nothing special. Yes that was the best part of the movie....but only because the rest of it was rather dull. The movie got somewhat interesting with about 30 minutes to go.The main character, Adaline, was flat. Quite dull. Her love-interest was a very nice guy; I guess he was okay. There were no tear-jerk moments. Definitely nothing I haven't seen before a dozen times. I guess it's a standard average love-story that is watchable on a rainy day.

"I enjoyed the Inferno film for the most part as I'm very fond of Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. One of the main reasons that I like these books so much is because they provide such a wealth of background historical information so they're a prefect blend of education and entertainment.While it was obviously impractical to include an involved literary discussion of Dante's Inferno in the film, it's a shame that it was barely touched on at all as to me, it was one of the most interesting aspects of the entire story. Like many, I was also surprised and disappointed by the changed ending. The book's solution was challenging but elegant; the filmclunky and predictable. Pity.",sadness
Starting with the story of the movie.. the story was gok but sometimes it make the movie more like a unbelievable fairy tale and some times it lacks the story.. Himesh(R0cky) is a unknown person who is traveling from places to places because of his past and he saw Mona Laizza(Nargis) and fall in love with her her... some times the story gets very difficult to understand because of some bad writing i guess its the writer fault.Acting and Music Himesh was very good he acted better then in his last movie radio songs were good Mona Laizza did good job in this movie she was in character all the time not in the starting i thought she missed it but after few mins when she start talking it was good and i was shocked :p.. Gulshan Grover was 0k same for Javed Sheikh..it was a good time pass on the whole i give it 7/10 for acting and music i don't like the story very much because of the terrorists and all..,sadness
"I can't believe how rude some people can be, this movie was so beautiful to me and I had to create an account because I want to offer my support against the haters.I can see how the movie might seem slow to some. This isn't your typical movie with unrealistic drama at every corner. It is so emotional and relatable because it shows something everyone (well most everyone) has gone through. Breakups can be so heartbreaking, and all of the elements of this movie come together to convey that with aching subtlety. It is rare that you see a film that can make you feel so many things with just one look the actress gives or one strategically placed piano note. Shannon (Zoe) is especially gifted, her range of emotion is incredibly refreshing.I never cry during movies, but this one really took me by surprise. So much tension builds up, and you see these two people who were once in love now fighting with each other and so angry. You start to find out how it all fell apart, but also without actually seeing the moment they fell in love. Then they hit you with that moment and you finally understand why they are so hurt. That scene was so incredible beautiful, and I credit both ladies for how amazing they did at appearing so in love. So many movies you see people fall in love and it doesn't look real. The culmination of that scene is what really got me to shed a few tears. I thought it would have been some sort of crazy inception situation where the actresses fell in love while filming the scene where they fell in love. I doubt that happened, but it would have been cool.Anyway, I recommend this movie to anyone who has been through heartbreak. Anyone who appreciates beautiful acting in a film that pays attention to every fine detail. Everyone involved in the movie really did an amazing job. Thank you for making me feel this way because it is something I really needed.",sadness

Where are the huge waves and destruction of the Statue of Liberty? Where are the nuclear blasts and shock waves? No flaming comet is shown approaching earth or rampaging contagion depicted spreading across globe. While the movie is well acted, it is a bitter disappointment. There is no complete breakdown in the power grid, mobs of zombies, or any of the plethora of apocalyptic scenarios available to the film makers. It makes no sense at all and three stars are awarded simply because the acting is good. If there had been some suggestion that another planet had been discovered and only a short time was left until that earth would be obliterated by it, then it would worthy of a much better rating.",sadness

"If you thought that Silence of the Lambs broke genre boundaries, this movie is the updated, more relevant, and more groundbreaking film.A masterpiece; this film not only delivers an excellent detective story, but also showcases a well-crafted, intelligent female protagonist. I have never rooted for any detective (underdog detective, no less) as hard as I have in this film. Seyfried is great as a trauma sufferer willing to take the law into her own hands when the system lets her down. The entire film follows the protagonist, rather than focusing equal part on serial killer, but it does not detract from the depth film at all, and actually helps the pacing.Future movies need to look to this as a reference for how to build fulfilling characters without compromising the intensity of the plot.",sadness

"This movie will never win an Oscar, but it still surprised me and became my favorite summer movie this year. The plot, as in all good summer comedies, is simple. Two guys who crash weddings to pick up woman have zany adventures and learn a little something along the way. The real fun of this movie is in the actors, who deliver their performances perfectly. Owen Wilson is the aging California surfer type who may be ready to move on with his life. Vince Vaughn is his best friend who frequently acts like a spoiled, horny child but is actually a good guy. Christopher Walken is the slightly scary father of the love interest. So if you have seen Wilson in Shanghai Noon and Vaughn in Swingers and Walken in, well almost anything he has ever made, then you have seen these characters before. But still, they just work well together here. The movie contains just enough real emotion to keep you caring and enough absurdity and broad physical comedy to keep you laughing. This isn't Shakespeare, but it is funny. Highly recommend.",sadness

"The effects, the pictures and the music: there were good hands at the computer, all looks good. But that only doesn't make a good movie.The storyline could have been good, even the adaptation of the original tale. However, the way it was done made it become flat and not worth watching, except if your are looking for mere amusement and distraction.The two most crucial moment in the movie turned out to be ridiculous. The grand moment of the movie was just rushed and passed without having any effect on the watcher.All in all, this movie is another product of a simple amusement industry which misses the chance to induce a positive change in this world, despite it great potential. Disney himself once was inducing visions and ideals into his movies. But that is a long time ago.

"Films like Sixteen Candles personify what the eighties was all about.  And if you were a child of the 80s, you will probably identify with this film a lot more than the now younger generation.  The story is simple enough, but it works so well.  Molly Ringwald is particularly likeable in this, and she is almost irreplaceable in her part.  There are heaps of familiar faces, including small parts from many of the present day 'movie stars' ie John Cusack, Joan Cusack and Jami Gertz.  It's kind of daggy though, and when you tell people you watched it their response is usually ""Oh My God.  That is so OLD.""  But that's what I like about it. If you want to watch a film that reflects the eighties, forget the nostalgia trips of The Wedding Singer and Romy and Michelle.  Hire a true eighties product, such as Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, St Elmo's Fire.... The list goes on and on.",sadness

It avoids all of the cliché's of typical Hollywood rom-com's and delivers a movie that has both heart, and a lot of laughs.First of all, Amy Adams might be the best actress working today. Her charm is uncanny, and she is obviously gorgeous. To me, she can do no wrong, and in this film she's at the top of her game.The most pleasant surprise was British actor Matthew Goode. Not only is he handsome in a very realistic and believable way, he's also very funny and obviously an amazingly gifted actor who is about to become a major Hollywood player.Finally, the third star of this movie is the setting. Ireland is absolutely beautiful, and this film captures that amazingly well. From the rugged natural beauty, to the infamous charm of the locals.One of the best romantic comedies I've ever seen.

"For decades LAURA has had a big reputation as one of the all-time greats of Hollywood Golden Age cinema. People gush and sigh when they talk about it. It inspires awe. I had seen snippets of it over the years but always lost interest after about five minutes. Having just watched the whole thing through, I now know why. Three of the main characters are cast with boring actors, so that whenever they are on screen the movie sags and dies. Those actors are: Dana Andrews, Gene Tierney and Vincent Price. Tierney is at least beautiful, so that even though you don't care one whit about her as a human being she is pleasant to behold. And truth be told, she did excellent work in subsequent films. Andrews was one of the most nondescript actors of his generation with no distinguishing features and no passion. Vincent Price, who exuded villainy without trying, could have been better but he was either given bad direction by Otto Preminger or had not yet developed much as an actor; as he evolves through the course of the story we never care about him, never feel what he must be feeling, but only listen to his dialogue so that we can follow the plot. He goes through the motions of what his character is supposed to be in a limp fashion. He is supposed to be from Kentucky but hardly ever uses that accent, and when he does, it's weak. It is also puzzling that the title character, praised by others for her warmth and genius and intelligence and magnetism, would be attracted to such a zero. The script is good and witty and clever but these actors do not live up to it. There are, however, two actors who do indeed live up to it, and those actors are Clifton Webb and Judith Anderson. Whenever they are on screen the film crackles and delights. With this performance, Webb launched a long and successful screen persona as the sarcastic, effete authority figure. Anderson, with her softly cutting voice, chews up any acting partner other than Webb; her scene with Tierney in the ladies' room as she dissects her own character and that of Price is priceless! Dorothy Adams is also very good as Tierney's loyal maid. The plot itself is nothing special - just a rather routine murder mystery with more in-depth participants than usual. It's a handsome production that physically evokes the penthouse world of New York City in the 40s. The photography is attractive. The score is overrated. After the initial 8-note repeated opening motif the much-lauded title tune fizzles out.",sadness

"To say the least, watching this movie was an interesting experience. For one thing, ""The Broadway Melody"" predates the Hayes Code, which placed strong restrictions on what could and could not be seen (or heard) in movies. For example, we see numerous shots of Hank and Queenie in various states of undress, including shots of them in their undergarments as they change clothes, and even one of Queenie in the bathtub(!). No, nothing is revealed, but in 1929, it must have been scandalous to see this.Another interesting aspect of this film is that, despite the fact that it is a ""talkie,"" title cards like those seen in silent films appear throughout. Apparently, MGM wasn't quite sure how to progress the story of the movie as it switched to different sets.Another thing I noticed was the similarities between some of the characters' names to those of real people. Specifically, ""Jock Warriner"" sounds like ""Jack Warner"" (who was head of Warner Bros. Studios) and ""Francis Zanfield"" is similar to ""Florenz Ziegfeld"" (of Ziegfeld Follies fame). It would seem the writers didn't have far to go to create some of these characters.As for the acting, Bessie love is the best performer in the film. Her character, Hank (yes, a man's name!), is intelligent, strong-willed, determined, and tough-minded, and she deservedly received an Oscar nomination for her performance in this film.""The Broadway Melody"" is a somewhat dated movie (to echo the sentiment of TV Guide), but it is still worthwhile to watch. The script is a little hokey, but the performances (especially from the women) shine through.",sadness
"First things first: Lukatic is a mediocre director. I enjoyed ""21"" and ""Legally BLonde"" as light entertainment. There's no reason to expect ""Paranoia"" to be anything else. And it isn't.Overall, the movie is on part with ""21"" and that's the best that can be said.""Paranoia"" starts off nicely and builds up to a point where it could go anywhere and in a spectacular way. Sure, all those possibilities are predictable but many are also enjoyable. Yet, the movie, all of a sudden, decides to go nowhere.It stays between a very shallow message against today's social media, an anti-privacy warning and an outcome that is thoroughly predictable, but not in a nice way.To me, it seems absolutely equal with the big uninteresting flop that ""Now You See Me"" was. We have the same drive to appear smart and overexplain things in a manner that manages t debunk itself and show that under all the glitter the emperor is naked. In ""Now you See me"", the glitter was cheap ""wit"". Here, we have the wasted skills of Oldman and Ford. However, I'll take Oldman and Ford any day.",sadness
"Let me preface this by saying that I am a straight female who has been a fan of the SATC series since its second season. I have every episode on DVD and have honestly seen every episode at least 5 times, including the commentaries by Michael Patrick King. That said, I could not be more disappointed in the film. To say that this movie was for fans of the series is insulting in my opinion because where the series had heart, depth and some intelligence, the movie had labels, poop jokes and lame choices by the characters.First of all, yes, Carrie Bradshaw is the main character, but could the other 3 women have been treating any more cavalierly? The ""plot lines"", if you can call them that, for the other characters seemed to be thrown into the mix just to give them something to do while Carrie ran around town, changing outfits and hair colors to the delighted shrieks of 15 year old fans. I can only imagine that was the audience the film wanted to capture because expecting grown women to follow this crap is insanity.Secondly, the ending of the film made me completely lose respect for Carrie. I cannot imagine an emotionally healthy 41 year old woman making the same choice she made. I think she needs intensive therapy because she is obviously a masochist who values the ability to purchase brand name couture more than her own happiness. And if the ability to buy couture is what makes her really happy, well, then, the 15 year old target audience should be thrilled.That said, I probably will see the sequel. I'm hoping they bring in more writers from the series to add some of the emotional oomph that this movie painfully lacked. *sigh* I just can't seem to quit SATC.",sadness

"I went to see this film on a Sunday afternoon, 4 o'clock. I walked into the theatre expecting only a few scattered seats to be occupied by ladies of a certain age, but to my surprise ànd contentment the theatre was filled for about 90% with both genders and all ages. And why not? I have read some article in some movie magazine saying that this is supposedly a film with a relatively small budget aimed at a relatively small audience (aforementioned ladies) but why would that be? I could not have been the only one in the audience who has no similarities with the film's characters: I am not nearing 60 years of age, I am not divorced, I have no children, I am not having an affair. Yet I do have a sense of humour and that is really all that is required when watching ""It's Complicated"".Because boy, this movie is funny as hell. And I was not the only one to think so: both genders and all ages were bursting with laughter throughout the movie. The jokes were really good, the actors even better. Meryl Streep was excellent (but hey, has anybody ever seen less than excellence of this lady?), Alec Baldwin was solid, Steve Martin should really take on more serious roles because he's pretty good at it and let's not forget John Krasinski who has a small but very cute and very funny part in this movie.This is definitely one to watch.

"Well if I was Anna Kendrick I would fire my agent.... preferably out of a cannon.I really think this film was greenlit solely on an idea and without a script which was made up as the film went along.Mike (Adam Devine) and his younger brother Dave (Zac Efron) are always causing chaos and embarrass their parents. So they are asked by their parents to bring dates for their sister's wedding in Hawaii which means they will behave themselves. I have no idea why the parents never thought that they might bring two chaotic idiots.This is exactly what happens. After an internet search they meet Tatiana (Audrey Plaza) and Alice (Anna Kendrick) who are two wild party girls who pretend to be respectable and responsible in order to be their wedding dates in Hawaii where they plan to cut loose.The film is just badly structured, it wants to be a bad taste, high jinks film like Neighbours or The Hangover but the script is poor, even boring with a few key set pieces such as the quad bike scene but the actors have to resort to silliness just to pad out the film.

"Eclipse was by far my favorite book in the saga. As a guy, I felt it had the perfect blend of action, romance, drama, and suspense. The movie did try to stay true to the book as much as possible but I feel it still lacked what made the book great.The acting is definitely better over the last two. I still feel a little awkward watching Bella. Edward definitely has gotten better. I've gotten several good laughs out of the movie. Got some nice flashbacks of other characters. But it still lacked overall magic for me.The things I feel is missing from the movie is suspense and chemistry. The love triangle is back and was a bit more entertaining now that all three of them are interacting more. But I still find the lack of chemistry between the characters glaringly obvious. I often had to think about my feelings back when I was reading the book to fortify what I saw on screen. In my opinion, they used too many words(and dialogue from the book) to describe what's going on instead of SHOWING(acting) us what's going on.The climax in the book was what made Eclipse my favorite of the saga, however, I can't say the same for the movie. The climax was disappointing and anti-climatic. Such dramatics for a walk in the park.I still feel the movie deserve the theater experience but I won't say boo to waiting for DVD release.",sadness

"Dear Gary,    Somehow your letter was no surprise (and I think you knew that it was no surprise or you would have tried to break the news more gently); somehow I think we understand what the other is going to say long before we say it—a proof of love and, I think, a protection against misunderstanding. So I've been expecting this letter for five weeks now—and I still don't know how to answer it.    Bohemia is a dreadful, wonderful place. It is full of hideous people and beautiful poetry. It is a hell full of windows into heaven. It would be wrong of me to drag a person I love into such a place against his will. Unless you walk into it freely, and with open despairing eyes, you can't even see the windows. And yet I can't leave Bohemia myself to come to you—Bohemia is inside of me, in a sense is me, was the price I paid, the oath I signed to write poetry.    I think that someday you'll enter Bohemia—not for me (I'm not worth the price, no human being is), but for poetry—to see the windows and maybe blast a few yourself through the rocks of hell.

"MONSTER'S BALL / (2001) **** (out of four)When I finish reading a great book, I don't close it right away. Treasuring the story's emotional grasp, I just sit there and hold it for a minute, enthralled, sensing the character's lives are continuing even as I put the book away. ""Monster's Ball"" is a similar experience. The film contains so much truth, vigor, and so many harrowing moments, I just stared at the screen through the ending credits. Even after a second viewing the conviction did not diminish. It really says something about a movie when you know what happens and you're equally as mesmerized every time you watch it.
Most movies about depravity are really about entertainment, but director Marc Forster avoids preachy speeches, big sappy moments, and melodramatic music. Even during the movie's most important scenes, Forster does not overplay the material. He knows that careful, quiet dialogue, and long, silent pauses speak louder than lengthy emotional summaries.Consider a scene where a character checks his father into an old folk's home. It does not feature long good-byes or conclusive hugs. Instead, it projects unflinching, raw emotion. ""You must love him very much,"" reassures an attendant to the character who replies, ""No I don't, but he is my father""The character, Hank, is played by Billy Bob Thornton, who makes his Academy Award-winning performance in ""Sling Blade"" look like SNL material. Hank, bitter and racist, lives in a Southern country house with his son, Sonny (Heath Ledger), and father (Peter Boyle). Hank and Sonny work as prison guards on death row. Sonny desperately wants out of the family business, especially after an unpleasant emotional reaction to the latest execution. When Hank explodes at him for his mistake, Sonny teaches his father a lesson he will never forget. 
The film eventually becomes a story about the relationship between Hank and the widow of the man he has just executed. She's played by Halle Barry, who was paid an extra one-million dollars for doing an extended sex scene completely nude. This is a gradual, yet sudden relationship that is not based on physical attraction or love, but emotional need and depravity.
Forster makes interesting editing choices. During certain scenes, he cuts back and forth between separate occurrences while the central action fills the soundtrack. Especially unique is how he handles a sex scene. While two characters engage in some of the most graphic stimulated sex of last year, Forster flashes images of a caged bird before us. A metaphor of shattered innocence or repressed emotion, perhaps?Actually, Forster fills ""Monster's Ball"" with metaphors, including the title itself. He even includes a moving soundtrack of timid rhythms and sudden beats, symbolizing the characters complex states of mind. Forster's haunting, daring feature reminds us why we all love the movies.",sadness

In fact, everything in this film is second hand.I had no hopes for SJP as an actress after SATC movies' disaster except discovering how much scarier the woman can get in a relatively short time, but Hugh just killed me with his wooden awkward performance. I think he or rather his agents must realize he's past those adorable insecure English guys and irresistible cads. You're not there anymore, mate! It is absolutely obvious he can act other parts, like I loved American Dreamz (though not only for him). Actually he'd be amazing in a role that brings out the slightly sinister side you can smell just looking at him. Time to stop charming and start acting.",sadness

"The movie begins with a lousy, redundant voice-over to explain what we're seeing. (Thank you very much, Mister Narrator, but I have eyes so I can see someone is driving a car, is having an accident, etc.) And from there the condescending force-feeding just doesn't let up. This movie is a great example of a creative team telegraphing to you exactly what you're supposed to feel every second, instead of letting you discover what a movie's about by yourself. After about 20 minutes, I figured the people behind this movie must be rookies, so I looked up on IMDb and saw their list of credits is pretty thin. This movie may have been OK if there had been a LOT more re-writes and a creative consultant was hired. The artistic voice of this movie was too timid and predictable to make this an interesting movie.",sadness

"Okay, we all know we can compare this to Taken. Same actor: Liam Neeson. Near the same location: Eastern Europe. Similar plot as far as rescuing/redeeming a person/persona. Yet, there are enough differences in this movie to make the experience stand out from Taken. First off, Taken is more of a ""go-get-em action/thriller"", and during that experience you were confident in Liam's ability to pummel through every obstacle that got in his way. Unknown is more of a dark suspense. It has good action, but it is scattered and mostly contains mystery, questionable phenomena, and thought-provoking circumstances as your entertainment.Here I (and probably other viewers) felt less certain about Liam's capabilities mainly because he is playing DEFENSE instead of OFFENSE, plus with the aid of the identity context itself. Liam certainly doesn't feel invincible here. There are many tense, close-call type situations that don't necessarily involve fighting and jumping onto a boat.Also, the plot of Taken is almost as straightforward as it could get, finding his daughter through one witness, one trafficker one locale at a time. Don't get me wrong, Taken was fun, but as soon as Unknown really settles in, it feels as if there are three or so antagonists/enemies at the same time and therefore provokes many more questions that you want answered. I have to give credit to the use of multiple characters who were quite unpredictable, by the end when you look back to the beginning and see all that's transpired you feel like NONE of the characters were who they used to be. Last note, the photography was satisfying. Throughout the film it has a dreary/overcast/stormy type of feel that emphasizes the tension and downward motion of Liam Neeson's feelings towards his sanity. With respect to Taken, overall it's a chilling, twisty, and enjoyable experience.",sadness
"I was walking home the other evening having just watched this at the theatre. Two guys were ahead of me on the street and had just seen it as well. Not intending to listen in on their conversation ... I did anyway, *LOL*. One asked his friend what he thought about the movie and the second took a moment to think about it. His answer? ""Twisted man, too twisted!"" Thoreau wrote in Walden that ""the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."" In 'Little Children,' we see that quiet desperation played out to full effect by desperate housewives, ex-cons and damaged loners. A deep study of loneliness, 'Little Children' is morally ambiguous and doesn't judge. It uses humour, it uses dread, and it is a film that is at times quirky, intelligent and ultimately fascinating.I liked a lot of things about this movie and in the week since I saw it, I've grown to like it more. Thematically it should have been a terrible downer: a collection of people who've all settled into what seems like the beginning of the end. They've married, started having kids and every single one of them wakes up in the morning with dread. ""Is this all that is left?"" They have become, or more importantly, believe that they have become completely purposeless in the next of a continuing doldrum of empty days. Eternity awaits and eternity is purposeless existential hell.What is remarkable about a film whose subject should be so bleak, is the warmth and humour within it. Characters in 'Little Children' reject the lack of purpose, the unhappiness and try to re-inject a passion for life that they once had. At its most extreme, the quest for passion and purpose is lead by Noah Emmerich -- certainly most of the humour comes from his character. Winslet, Wilson and Emmerich are all flawed (who isn't?) but sympathetic. And then there is Jackie Earle Haley.How difficult must it have been to play a convicted sex offender who is both repellent and *gasp* sympathetic? If you're Jackie Earle Haley and you are stealing a film away from bigger stars and you've got a great part, then apparently it isn't very hard at all. Creepy, potentially dangerous but also fairly benign and pitiable, Haley gives a much over-looked performance in what is quickly becoming a much over-looked film. He has given what I think is one of the best performances this year, and what is certainly the best performance of his entire career.'Little Children' is ""twisted man, too twisted"" but it is also very good and very compelling. Well worth the risk and extremely well paced. It was only after the film had ended that I noticed how long the film was. Completely engrossing, I recommend it highly.",sadness
"It has been said that acting is being truthful under false circumstances; this movie is one of the most truthful I've seen, ever. In a film world where good acting has taken a backseat to realism, this movie sacrifices neither. I think the complaints primarily come from people who do not truly understand the art and craft of acting, and the script and performances would probably be appreciated more by the theatre community than those who only experience performances by going to the movies. And if you thought the script was unrealistic, well, you should probably stick with documentaries. The only deviation from a real life couple's fight in the script is that the scenes are more entertaining.",sadness

"Not too bad for some fairly easy entertainment and intrigue - if you can tolerate the unnecessarily gratuitous violence and blood which at times is pretty sickening for me. But when the intrigue ends about half way through when the mystery is uncovered, the film degenerates into comedic posturing by a ridiculous number of body guards unnecessarily threatening a couple of defenceless men and a morally bankrupt story line which could so easily have raised the tenor of the film if it had included an ounce of humanity. The only attempt at this, with a contrived reconciliation which flew in the face of all normal sensibilities was promptly snuffed out along with the most of the robotic characters that behaved as though they were supposed to have been in a sci fi movie. Even the attempt at romance was more like a pair of the 'Wooden Tops' getting together. An ill conceived plot that started well but completely failed to deliver.",sadness

"Nothing is worse than knowing that you have met the girl of your dreams only to find out she has a boyfriend that is so unbelievably superior to you that you have no chance to win her over. That is exactly what happens to Nick Twisp (Michael Cera), but instead of meekly accepting his fate like a good little nerd he decides to fight back by creating a persona his French-loving would-be girlfriend cannot resist, Francois Dillinger. Francois appears periodically throughout the film to offer advice and, more often, take control of the situation by flagrantly defying authority or bringing his bad boy machismo into play.I imagine Francois is what every stock French resistance fighter was like when he was sixteen with no war to fight; well dressed in gleaming white slacks and sandals, sporting a casual-looking button down shirt, but with a thin mustache and cigarette to add mystery and mystique. The very image of Francois makes me laugh. This also happens to be the only movie where parents are the unknowing consumers of illicit narcotics and it is actually funny.",sadness

"It is certainly not a horrible movie. Leonard Maltin called it a Bomb. It has decent acting and a reasonable plot. It's very talky. Unlike most end-of-the - world movies, there are no efforts to come up with food, resist annihilation, hole up somewhere, although those things are talked about. It begins with what seems to be the death of all the people in the Puerto Rican area where this takes place. The main characters are saved because they were SCUBA diving and had oxygen while others didn't. This opens a whole can of worms. Theere are people all over with oxygen supplied for various reasons. We have three figures, a young wife who feels because of her relationship with her driven husband, she has missed out on much of life. She's really quite stunning. We have the husband, a take-no-prisoners businessman who has crossed the line many times. Finally, we have his nihilistic, whiny attorney who spouts philosophy and poetry, but is rather ineffectual. He and the wife begin a relationship, but even she tires of his ramblings and his negative discourse. There is a sad conclusion with many unanswered questions. Just a rather dull, talky movie.",sadness

"So this is what Jennifer Lopez can do when she tries! She is well cast as a tough Chicago female cop. I once had a friend who was a female cop in Washington, DC, I hung out with her cop pals sometimes, took part in their banter about their latest arrests, was even taken to see them in the cells, and all of that sort of thing is completely accurately portrayed in this film. This is obviously very much Lopez's own natural element: street life and all that goes with it. I can actually believe that she could have become just such a policewoman. She should play more such roles with true grit, as they suit her better than normal romances. She actually looks completely natural when she is punching people in the face and laying them out cold. (I hope she doesn't do that at home.) Apparently she insisted that the mysterious man in the film must be played by Jim Caviezel, which was the perfect choice, and her instinct was spot on. Caviezel does a wonderful job, and his mysterious eyes are just right for someone who does not actually know whether he is dead or alive, and could be either. The deeper purpose of this film is to show the dark, swirling psychological whirlpools of Lopez's family story on the one hand and Caviezel's tale on the other hand. Lopez is superb at conveying her searing emotional turmoil, which is constantly erupting above the surface as rage. Both her father and her brother are uncontrollably violent wife-bashers. She did the right thing as a girl by calling the police when he was beating up her mother, and had him arrested. Not only did the father never really speak to her again, but the mother could not forgive her either, which is of course typical of many battered wives, who suffer from the psychological sickness of not wanting to put a stop to it, and who have married these men on purpose (subconsciously, of course); the sister-in-law is another one who is just the same. Really, there is nothing more annoying than a battered woman who secretly wants it. The irony is that Lopez herself, in going 'to the side of the law' and becoming a policewoman, ends up using her fists a lot herself, but this time to stop crime, not to beat up a spouse. This shows how violent impulses can be turned away from the bad and be used for the good sometimes. (However, special forces soldiers, who are an extreme version of this, generally end up as psychological wrecks, and I know some.) Caviezel's dilemma and the coincidence of their double meetings border on the supernatural, and talented director Luis Mandoki and equally talented writer Gerald di Pego (they earlier collaborated on the excellent 1999 film 'Message in a Bottle') stress all the most mysterious angles in this tale, which makes the whole film more profound than it might otherwise have been, without ever descending into affectation. Shirley Knight gives excellent acting support, and the whole cast are good. This is a highly worthwhile film, which takes a star who often does superficial films and puts her into something real, with excellent results.",sadness

"I can't think of an actor better suited to play the expressionless chronic bachelor Don at the heart of Jim Jarmusch's newest movie than Bill Murray. His mournful hound-dog face, which hides any trace of what's going on inside the head on which it sits, stares blankly at the T.V., at other people, sometimes at nothing, betrays itself with the slightest movement of the mouth or twitch of the eyes. It's a characterization Murray has so down pat that I'm tempted to think he's not really acting all that much, but he's so perfectly cast that it doesn't much matter whether he's acting or not.If you're not familiar with the movies of Jim Jarmusch, ""Broken Flowers"" is a nice introduction, as it's the most accessible Jarmusch film I've seen. I'm not a huge fan, but I liked this movie quite a lot. Don receives an anonymous letter one day from a past girlfriend, telling him he has a 19-year-old son who may come looking for him. Murray's friend, Winston (played amusingly by the chameleon Jeffrey Wright), convinces him to track down a handful of women who could have possibly been the mother and resolve the mystery. Don agrees to it, seemingly not so much because he has a need to know but because he has nothing better to do. What follows is a series of scenes with each past girlfriend, during which their interactions with Don tell us heaps about their relationship back when they were dating. Some are affectionate, some are distant, one is downright scarily angry, but all are played beautifully by a quartet of actresses: Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange and Tilda Swinton.This is Jarmusch, so there aren't necessarily any tidy answers, and I don't think I give anything away by saying that the mystery is never solved. Life is messy, and it doesn't always happily resolve itself just because we want it to. I liked how subtle the film was; Don doesn't make any huge ground-breaking discoveries about himself, but nevertheless you sense that he's a slightly different person after his journey than he was before it.You'll have to be patient, as Jarmusch tells his story very slowly, and nearly all of Don's interaction with others is ponderously awkward. But the movie slowly begins to fascinate, and you find yourself watching the faces of the women he visits (and examining the visible details of their lives) much in the same way that Don is himself, looking for the slightest hint that she might be the one who sent that fateful letter.A very fine film, poignant and sad in a rather obscure way, and one that stays in your mind for a while after seeing it.Grade: A-",sadness

"So a guy who claims to know your dead son turns up at your house one day. He seems nice and looks like that bloke off of Downton so you let him stay for a while... That is pretty much all I knew about this film before I went to see it. What follows is an enjoyable thriller with laughs aplenty and an excellent central performance from Dan Stevens (more on that later).The plot, at the end of the day, is fairly nonsensical and there are some troubling loose ends that I found a little unsatisfactory. I can't say that any of the story is particularly surprising or original but what does that matter when everyone making it and everyone in the audience seems to be having so much fun? The cinema I was in was probably around half full and while there was nobody in full-on hysterical laughter, there was a satisfactory amount of appreciative chuckling (me included).I feel that the majority of my enjoyment of this film should really be credited to Dan Stevens in the main role. His character is charming, pleasant and helpful and yet strangely sinister and unsettling from the outset and he plays it absolutely perfectly. You can't help but like him even though you're not sure that you should. Apart from a smallish role in ""The Fifth Estate"", I am only familiar with Stevens from Downton Abbey and his role in this couldn't have been more different from both of these. I look forward to seeing how his career progresses but this was an excellent example of his versatility as an actor.Overall a good Saturday night out at the cinema but I can't imagine it is the kind of classic film I would watch again and again.",sadness

"Widower dad, nervous and self-conscious about his ability to raise two preteens by himself, takes the youngsters into the Colorado mountains for a vacation at a cabin once owned by his deceased wife's father. Combination ghost story/mental breakdown thriller is pretty much scuttled by a confused, jumbled screenplay, full of dead ends. Eric McCormack heads the small cast, which also includes two child actors whose performances are utterly flat, and Donnelly Rhodes as a weathered sheriff with a bad cough. McCormack gives it a try, but there's no character for him to play, and his constant running from room to room grows wearisome (and negates any suspense in the scenario). Andrew Currie is responsible for the mediocre direction, from a thin, derivative script by Michaelbrent Collings. There's really only one well-directed sequence in the picture: a flashback to the wife's death. Genre entry had potential as a jittery, who's-in-the house scare-flick, but results are ultimately tepid. *1/2 from ****",sadness
"Saw this today at the Ziegfield Theatre in NYC - if you can see it in a theater with a really big screen, that's the way to go. It's a feast for the senses. A musical with a story in between the songs, so the husband won't get bored! We loved it - very engaging, beautifully shot, excellent acting and singing, extremely entertaining. Judi Dench is pure delight, and Marion Cotillard does a stunning job - she's brilliant at singing and acting. Some seem to be saying that Nicole Kidman's part wasn't substantial enough, but I love the song she sang and her limited screen time fits with the idea of her character being unattainable in Guido's eyes. She's seen in posters and talked about before she's actually interacting with him, so it adds to the idea that he keeps her on a pedestal. Perfectly appropriate. About Guido -- you will believe Daniel Day Lewis is Italian! He totally transforms his body to be the character. Sophia Loren looks great, Kate Hudson pulls off a good job dancing and singing, and the costumes and sets really make it all work together. BUT the best part of this film is Penelope Cruz! She is simply amazing in this - sexy, sensitive, earthy, funny, and full of depth. She gets better and better with every role. I did wish she was on screen more. Hubby nearly slid off his seat watching her opening scene, she's so hot. I really don't understand the naysayers and less-than-glowing reviews.

"Though I was not expecting too much from this Rohit Shetty directorial as I'm aware of Rohit's taste , but I ended up in a situation and mood like – ""Expect the Unexpected"". Take it in a positive whim . So let's see how Dilwale actually is !After their last outing in Chennai Express, I kind of had an inkling of what Rohit Shetty and Shah Rukh Khan were going to offer in Dilwale. Just another typical run-of-the mill entertainer. While Chennai Express didn't leave me disappointed, it didn't leave me in awe either. But Dilwale still does manage to look a lot more appealing from the promos, songs and the trailer. And two and a half hours later, I came out completely satisfied. Each Penny was well spent!Performances make the film imminently watchable. SRK, as Raj, does what he does best --- romances his leading lady with ease, beats the hell out of his rivals while playing the ideal brother to Varun. Of course, how can there be another Dilwale sans the leading lady of the original? Kajol, as effortlessly spontaneous as ever, has a relatively shorter role than what you would have expected. Varun Dhawan's comic timing will make you sit back and take note. Kriti Sanon does a reasonably good job of her role. The other members of the cast are all armed with funny scenes and dialogues. One of the best things about the film is that all the other characters are fleshed out to keep the comic element up. It may sound a little audacious but Rohit Shetty's favourite Sanjay Mishra, who plays a buyer of stolen goods, is even funnier than the amazing Johnny Lever. The comedy element in the film is its strength. With top notch performances from the likes of Varun Sharma, Boman Irani, Sanjay Mishra and Johnny Lever, you will definitely laugh out loud every time they are on screen. A special applause has to be reserved for them, as they lift up he film, the moment you feel it might lag.The direction by Shetty is awesome, to put it simply. His vision and the scale of the film is insurmountable by any other entertainer in this genre. There are no compromises on budgets and it reflects on the film.The music does justice to the ethos of the film. The songs are well- paced, except for Daayre, and contribute to strengthening the romantic quotient of the film. The background music is haunting and somehow reminded me of the Om Shanti Om theme. The soulful music is complemented by the breathtaking locales. The film is (obviously) set in Goa, Rohit Shetty's favourite destination, and Bulgaria. The latter, alongwith Iceland where the song Gerua is shot, gives you some awe-inspiring visuals on the big screen.Moments make for great memories in a Rohit Shetty film, and so some scenes deserve a special mention. The five-minute speed dating between Shah Rukh and Kajol is interesting, while the one where Mukesh Rishi and Pankaj Tripathy narrate the Shah Rukh-Kajol back story is deeply engaging.All in all, Dilwale was a great joyride with plenty to watch out for. Superb music. Stunning action. Unbelievable landscapes. Energetic youth in the form of Varun-Kriti. And of course, the enigmatic SRK-Kajol! Each of these elements can make you want to watch the film by themselves. And when put together, Dilwale is the great entertaining result! The film ends on a high note with Tukur Tukur, a song that you will keep singing to yourself long after the film is done. Watch it, as by Rohit Shetty's standards, it's his most complete and the most entertaining light comedy romantic movie.A Must Watch",sadness

"TOWN & COUNTRY / (2001) **1/2 (out of four)By Blake French: 	 After being rescheduled more times than you can count on one hand, finally ""Town & Country"" hits theaters. With more production problems than my neighbor's dog has flees, I was not expecting the film to be of any extraordinary quality. It isn't. I did, considering the respectable cast and crew, expect to laugh. I did, but not enough. This is the kind of comedy where we laugh when the jokes are presented, but there are not enough of them. Therefore, we want more, but the movie never delivers-leaving us with a feeling of disappointment. With a budget of over 90 million and shooting dates that range over three years, this film should have been the pearl of the ocean. Although ""Town & Country"" has its moments of hilarity, insight, and interest, the film as a whole does not quite work.
	""Town & Country"" stars Warren Beatty, whose previous satire ""Bulworth"" offered more biting comedy than this film multiplied by three. He plays Porter Stoddard, an acclaimed New York architect, who is having an affair with a beautiful, married musician (Nastassja Kinski). Porter has a wealthy lifestyle and a loving wife, Ellie (Diane Keaton), who suspects nothing from her husband for 25 years. The Stoddard's have a close-nit friendship with another couple, Mona (Goldie Hawn), and Griffin (Garry Shandling from ""What Planet Are You From?""). Griffin is also committing adultery, but his wife discovers his betrayal and immediately dumps him-even though she is not exactly faithful herself. 	The setup is basically just a clothesline from which other related situations evolve. Although often interesting, adultery isn't enough to develop a story over 100 minutes in length. The movie begins well (after some painful music during the opening credits) but stumbles very early, with its characters wandering from scene to scene with nothing much to do or say. Then the story becomes redundant, with Porter making the same mistakes repeatedly. But surprisingly, there is very little tension involved with the plot, simply because we do not care about the characters. There is just not enough at stake here. There are a few hilarious scenes that transpire when the characters attempt to cover up their deceitful decisions, and the actors are consistently fun to watch, with likable chemistry and energy. The cast does a great job with their charismatic and entertaining performances, making this movie relatively easy to watch. But even they can't bring enough life into this otherwise desperate, deprived material.
	""Town & Country"" is clearly trying to say that people can engage in adultery without much effort or thought, but it is not fulfilling or constructive. During the film's closing minutes, Porter explains, in a scene much too obvious for its own good, that sex has not filled the emptiness inside him. We never believe that Porter felt such loneliness, however, for several reasons:1)  Warren Beatty does not do a convincing job at executing his character's emotions. All of the characters feel very external. We seldom feel anything for any of them.2)  The story runs into a particularly noticeable series of problems during its last third. When it should be calming down, focusing in on the character's emotional areas, it does exactly the opposite: introduces new events completely unrelated to the material before. We also meet numerous characters that only distract us from the movie's theme. There is some funny material within these segments of the movie, but for the most part, these sequences really detour the plot.""Town & Country"" isn't as bad as many people are saying. It is just a disappointment considering the ample potential. With 90 million dollars, over three years, and names like Warren Beatty, Diane Keaton, Goldie Hawn, Garry Shandling, Andie MacDowell, and Charlton Heston, we come to expect a whole lot more. I have seen special effects laden action thrillers made for half the cost of ""Town & Country"" and much less talent, but so much more was projected on the screen. The only thing this production does with its talent and money is prove that raunchy sex comedies can be made with older generations too.",sadness
"I may be bias because I read and loved the books but it was a great movie. Just like any indie movie just starting out, it has its flaws. I felt because I read the book I noticed how rushed it was and all the changes but it wasnt that bad.

Definitely gave me that throwback vibe and cult classic.",sadness

My mother saved anyone    who asked, but never me,  never the way I wanted:  her palms skimming my limbs  for injury, her fingers finding  what hurt, her lips whispering,  I got here just in time.",sadness

"To be completely honest, I went into this movie expecting to thoroughly trash it as soon as I walked out. I thought it was destined to be another cheesy rom-com with a predictable ending and terrible acting. I was wrong. Little did I know, this was another Judd Apatow produced comedy, and almost everything he's touched over the past three years has turned into pure gold, including ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"". ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is no exception. Jason Segal of ""How I Met your Mother"" fame, stars as a lovable but lazy music composer for a CSI-esque television drama. After his famous girlfriend (Kristen Bell) dumps him, he decides to take a vacation to Hawaii to deal with it. Little does he know, that his ex-girlfriend is travelling to the same resort as him – with her new overly-flamboyant musician boyfriend in tow (Russell Brand.) Mila Kunis (""That 70's Show"") plays a receptionist at the resort, and proves she can actually play a likable role. Kunis has great chemistry with Segal, and their budding relationship is surprisingly one of the highlights of the movie. The script, which was also written by Segal, is consistently funny throughout, and really hones in on the hilarious one liners and awkward situational humor that seem to be the strength of most Apatow movies. Segal has definitely elevated himself into a solid comic lead. You can't help but feel bad for the guy as things gradually go from bad to worse for him. That said, Russell Brand, who plays eccentric musician Aldous Snow, steals every scene he's in. He plays a character in which the viewer is supposed to dislike, but it's virtually impossible. Everything he does, from his words, to his facial expressions, to his ridiculous body language, is hilarious. Now I may only be high on this movie because I had exceptionally low expectations going in, but it's definitely a solid comedy from start to finish. With the exception of having to see Segal's junk at least six or seven times, it was a gem.",sadness
"A very entertaining and well-made comedy. The story is pretty simple with The Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) this time taking a stage hand job at a circus where he unwittingly becomes the star of the show with his antics. The best moments of the film are the expertly choreographed comic routines. The climactic tightrope walk is a bit of a letdown next to the earlier, funnier bits (like the opening funhouse chase), but that is a small detraction. The unrequited love story adds some much needed depth to the film, giving it that bittersweet quality that any good comedy needs to be effective. Chaplin here gives us just a peek at that serious side of The Tramp that we would see more of in his last two films. Beautiful ending.",sadness

"This has got to be one of the most under-rated and under seen sequels in history. Arthur 2 is not as good as the film that preceeded it but it is NOT a bad film. Arthur 2 if anything gives us the film that Dudley Moore and Steve Gordon were trying to back in 1981. One of the main criticism's is that it gives out a bad message the alcoholism is good. The film does nothing of the sort, Arthur strives through out the film to change his drinking ways and succeeds in the final part of the film. The film itself is not as funny as Arthur was, but you hardly notice this because it tells a good dramatic story.Bud Yorkin handles the direction excellently, and the movie contains a magical back drop of Christmas time New York. Dudley is again funny and like-able, just as he was in Arthur, allthough both the Actor and the Character have matured. Liza Minelli is again kookie as Linda, allthough she plays the role like the preceeding seven years took place within a week. Nothing changes with her performance and one is greatful. One really feels for Arthur and Linda, as they struggle with the fact of first not being able to have children, and secondly being destitute. Without spoiling the movie for those who have not seen it, there is a happy ending. Burt Bacharach's score is again heartbreaking and wonderful and the title song sung by Chris De Burgh is as good as the Chris Cross original. And finally Sir John Gielguid makes a heart breaking and beautifull return as an Obi Wan Kenobi like Hobson. A christams ghost if you will.A Beatifull film. One ready for re-evaluation. Lets raise our glasses to Arthur and Linda.",sadness

"I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, I am surprised to say. I read some of the reviews here before watching it and wonder if we even watched the same movie. The movie had an extremely low budget (less then $2M), which is fine, you don't need a huge cast and expensive visual effects and the entire London Symphony Orchestra playing the score to make an enjoyable film. I'd like to see more of these kinds of films.I thought the Lousiana location lent a nice southern Gothic edge to the film. The house was beautiful and terrifying at the same time (I used to live in an old house like that, seriously, they are scary at night, when you are alone in the house, and the moonlight is shining through a circular window over the staircase...)The film kept me on the edge to the end. And the end... well, I won't talk about it, I had several theories as to what might be going on (as we all do when watching a suspense film) but the end still surprised me a little bit. Still, it made me think. It wasn't cheesy or tacked on.I thought Brittany Murphy was gorgeous in this film, as the sense of dread and terror slowly built up. Thora Birch was under-utilized and I wish her character had been developed a little more.No, this movie wasn't as creepy or terrifying as, say The Ring/Ringu, it had no blood or nudity or very little cussing. So maybe that's why so many people rated it so low. I liked it.",sadness
"'THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) This indie critical darling is one of the best reviewed movies of the year and up until the climax I thought it was a pretty impressive little film. It is a well acted and realistic character study though with the likes of Julianne Moore, Annette Bening, Mark Ruffalo, Josh Hutcherson and 'ALICE IN WONDERLAND's Mia Wasikowska. It's directed and co-written by Lisa Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg (who also wrote 'KEEPING THE FAITH' and co-wrote 'THE GIRL NEXT DOOR', which I'm a big fan of both). The acting is all impressive, especially Ruffalo and Bening. Moore is good but she's been much better, maybe it's just the character she's playing here that doesn't give her as much to work with. The directing is adequate and fitting to the material and the screenplay is full of natural and believable characters and dialog. Even the ending, which I didn't like, seems believable it's just that it turns the film into a much less valuable learning lesson.The film tells the story of Joni (Wasikowska) and Laser (Hutcherson) a brother and sister conceived through artificial insemination by their unhappy mothers Nic (Bening) and Jules (Moore). Joni is Nic's biological daughter and Laser is Jule's biological son and they were both conceived from the same sperm donor Paul (Ruffalo). On her eighteenth birthday, when she's legally able to do so without the consent of her mother, Joni contacts her biological father and she and Laser meet him secretly. Later their mothers find out about this and before allowing them to see him again demand to meet him as well. Nic, the controlling working mother, is very upset by the sudden involvement of Paul in her children lives but Jules (who has mostly been a stay at home mom) warms to him after he hires her to design and construct his back yard. Paul is a free spirited, fun loving co-op farmer and restaurant owner. This clashes with Nic but the rest of the family enjoys spending time with him and he really learns to love them as well. Complications arise.I was really fascinated by all of the characters and learned to really like them, all except for maybe Nic who was just a little to controlling and self righteous (but believable). Paul to me was the most relate-able and likable character and the story and growth of all of the characters kind of revolve around him. Without giving away too much the movie ends in conflict and one of the characters is sort of used and abused and left with a lot of unfair judgment placed upon him. It is realistic and believable though it just seems like the movie is making heroes out of the wrong characters and villains out of others, that don't deserve it. This left me very much disappointed in the movie as a whole and that's why I can't overwhelmingly recommend it.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOOi1HDSXyA",sadness
"I love the old 50's movies, and have since I was a kid. (It's easier to catch them these days with Cable TV.) So I appreciate the non-CG effects, the simple plots, the dialogue style, etc. But this movie went to extremes. There is a difference between holding off on the monster, to not ruin the suspense in the first 30 minutes... and waiting for the *last 20 minutes* to show it. The stop-motion animation is worse than movie of this era (Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, 20 Million Miles to Earth), and even worse then movies before it (King Kong, Mighty Joe Young). Seriously, Gumby looked better. And for some reason, a T-Rex has a bright red tongue that would make Gene Simmons envious. My 6-year old though it was funny, not scary. My 4-year old even said that the dinosaur and ""that mud"" (end scene) looks like ""the clay we play with"". I think that if it wasn't a T-Rex, but rather just a rabid and large wolf - it would have made a better movie.",sadness

I have read some comments say's that this feeling its what happened when you see one great movie, and maybe it is, but i don't think that way. In the end my main opinion its that the movie its great but the end make you feel sad and revolted with every thing that you seen in the movie.",sadness

"""Tart"" is a good illustration of old the Yogi Berra saying: ""If you don't know where you are going, you will probably end up someplace else"". Writer/Director Christina Waye (in her first feature) has managed to make a $3 Million movie that ends up someplace else. ""Tart"" is either a coming of age story devoid of characters that a rational person can connect with, a black comedy without any humor, or a sexploitation movie without anything that is particularly sexy.Unlike the standard Swain film, ""Tart"" actually employed a competent and experienced production designer. Good enough to provide two extremely nice shots: the scene of Swain and Barton taking a bubble bath together and the scene of Swain in the park-featuring a nice montage of the ""Alice in Wonderland"" sculpture. The symbolism incorporated into these elements supports the possibility that Waye (despite the absence of a linear logic or unity of tone) actually has some visionary talent and aspirations for making a quality film. It is even possible that Waye was trying for a fusion of the somewhat expressionistic ""Metropolitan"" and the camp classic ""Cruel Intentions"" which also deal with the Manhattan upper class. There are many camera shots framed by windows and doors yet few tight shots of faces and eyes. The former technique hinting at symbolism and the latter at intentional distancing from the characters and their motivations. ""Tart"" seemed on the verge of veering into camp territory at least twice and would have been well advised to keep going in that direction. First there was the scene where they try to dump the seemingly deceased Swain into the garbage chute. Then there is the whole bit about her father being Jewish (played to the same extreme as Joel Grey dancing with the Jewish guerrilla in ""Cabaret""). In her other films Swain's acting technique is to overwhelm each scene in which she appears (insert scenery chewing here) but in ""Tart"" she actually shows an ability to restrain herself. This is the best performance of her career. It also provides some clues about her physical deterioration from willowy super cute in ""Girl"" to hulking lumpy-faced in ""Pumpkin"". This transformation was about half-complete by the time she made ""Tart""; so go the ravages of time. Mischa Barton (""Sixth Sense's"" I feel better girl) and Lacey Chabet are excellent in supporting roles. The rest of the cast is simply horrible, although some of the blame for this should go to Waye's script and direction.",sadness
"In the early 90's , Kaizad Gustad struck a chord with Indian audience with niche films in form Bombay Boys. Over the years, he has lost energy to tap in quality product. Jackpot is yet another dud from Kaizad Gustad which will be forgettable once you leave the theater.Jackpot tells the story of con attempted by amateur gang members. Things turns topsy turvy when they discover about reverse con played upon them.Right from the openings credits inspired by a James Bond film to the typical action thriller set in Goa, Jackpot does not liven your spirit at any moment. Kaizad Gustad tries hard but falls flat on the face with weak script. The film do have some twist and turns but it never re- ignites the mood.

"Let not the title of my verse offend,    Nor let the pride contract her rigid brow; That helpless Innocence demands a friend,    Virtue herself will cheerfully allow: And should my pencil prove too weak to paint,    The ills attendant on the babe ere born; Whose parents swerved from virtue’s mild restraint,    Forgive the attempt, nor treat the Muse with scorn. Yon rural farm, where Mirth was wont to dwell,    Of Melancholy, now appears the seat; Solemn and silent as the hermit’s cell —    Say what, my muse, has caused a change so great? This hapless morn, an infant first saw light,    Whose innocence a better fate might claim, Than to be shunned as hateful to the sight,    And banished soon as it receives a name. No joy attends its entrance into life,    No smile upon its mother’s face appears, She cannot smile, alas! she is no wife;    But vents the sorrow of her heart in tears. No father flies to clasp it to his breast,    And bless the power that gave it to his arms; To see his form, in miniature expressed,    Or trace, with ecstacy, its mother’s charms. Unhappy babe! thy father is thy foe!    Oft shall he wish thee numbered with the dead; His crime entails on thee a load of woe,    And sorrow heaps on thy devoted head. Torn from its breast, by shame or pride,    No matter which — to hireling hands assigned; A parent’s tenderness, when thus denied,    Can it be thought its nurse is overkind? Too many, like this infant may we see,    Exposed, abandoned, helpless and forlorn; Till death, misfortune’s friend, has set them free,    From a rude world, which gave them nought but scorn. Too many mothers — horrid to relate!    Soon as their infants breathe the vital air, Deaf to their plaintive cries, their helpless state,    Led on by shame, and driven by despair, Fell murderers to become — Here cease, my pen,    And leave these wretched victims of despair; But oh! what punishments await the men,    Who in such depths of misery plunge the fair.",sadness

"After seeing the first Sex and the City movie, and finding it OKAY, I decided to take a stab at the second film. I am a huge fan of the HBO series, so i was naturally excited...THE GOOD: Yes, there were some funny moments, and some nice things to look at (clothes, design, men). I liked most of the music choices, and I did enjoy the first 20 minutes or so of the film because it seemed as though it would be building up to something interesting, but just these few things alone could not have made a good enough movie for one of the best shows to ever air on television. THE BAD: This movie had a lot of downfalls. Lets start with the plot (or lack there of). The audience was treated to four women that constantly complained about their ""problems"". I am not saying that their issues were not legitimate to regular women, but they did not present these issues in a way that would create an interesting plot..they were just seemingly simple problems that were over dramatized and annoying to listen to (lackluster marriage, boring job, declining hormones, having children...) In the middle of these ""problems"" we get to see how rich they are with their maids/nannys, change of expensive clothes every 4 minutes and fancy homes. All these things made it hard to sympathize with them. Yes, in the show we saw their lavish lifestyle, but this film was rubbing it in the audience's face, and it was a main part of the ""storyline"" when it really shouldn't have been. (plus, a lot of the clothing choices were NOT good) It seemed as though they threw in the idea of going to Abu Dhabi just to make things interesting, but it just made things worse. I felt as though there was a mocking/ undermining quality to the way they portrayed middle eastern customs... But more importantly (to me) is the fact that when i think of the show and its title ""Sex in the CITY"" I think of that city as NYC, NOT Abu Dhabi (really, what were they thinking?) Overall, i felt like this was a poorly executed film that had little resemblance to the show... I feel cheated.",sadness

"I approach Tim Burton films with a certain trepidation.  Will it be ""Edward Scissorhands"" or ""Batman II?""  With Burton you could get a quirky comedy, a dark thriller, or sweet morality tale.  And there's always the possibility of Danny DeVito chomping down on a raw fish. ""Big Fish"" combines Burton's unusual humor with a heart-wrenching story of a father-son deathbed reconciliation.  Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor share the role of Ed Bloom, one of the big fish from the movie's title while an SUV-sized catfish plays the other.  Bloom is a metaphorical and literal big fish in the small pond of Ashton, Alabama in this tale told mostly through flashback.  Jessica Lange plays his wife and Billy Crudup plays the son, Will, estranged from his father for the past three years.  Father and son are reunited as Finney lies dying of cancer. Ed Bloom has spent his life spinning his personal history into mythological proportions: an early encounter with a very tall man becomes a battle with a house-sized giant; a rural village is depicted as heaven on earth; military service during the Korean War morphs into a behind-the-lines mission that would make Duke Nukem proud.  Originally a true believer, Will now knows everything his father has told him was not just an exageration or even a tall tale but an outright lie.  In his effort to understand the truth behind his father's stories he learns to love the man as well as the mythology. And Burton delivers a terrific punchline at the end of the film that left me both tickled and weeping, a truly weird emotional state. Burton deals with mythic themes in ""Big Fish.""  Besides the surface story of the generational tension between father and son he explores the metaphor of the big-fish-in-a-small-pond by examining the impact Ed Bloom has had on the lives he's touched in his workaday contacts with colleagues, customers (he's a traveling salesman), and people in the small towns across the South. Not exactly ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" he still manages to show how all of us -- even the little fish -- have profound effects on the people around us. And of course love -- unrequited and reciprocated -- control almost all of Ed's many adventures. The acting is wonderful.  You will actually believe two Brits and a Scot (Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, and McGregor) are natives of small town Alabama.  Lange brings dignity and brio to the role of the long ""suffering"" wife -- and she still looks great(!)-- you believe she has had a long and loving life with Finney/McGregor.  DeVito is a delight in the role of a circus ringmaster.  But the scene-stealer is Bonham Carter in the dual role of Jenny and the crone witch.

"It doesn't seem like a stretch to suggest that America might now be ready to embrace films in the style of India's Bollywood films. While ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is far from a Bollywood tragic love story filled with singing and dancing, the way director Danny Boyle will rivet audiences with his film that is authentic to Indian culture while using a distinctly Western style of film-making might be enough proof that there is a profit to be made here.""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a drama exposing the tragic effects of poverty in gigantic Indian cities like Mumbai that is also fused with a modern day Indian fairytale. Jamal Malik is a young man on India's ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire"" and is a question away from one million dollars when he's arrested on suspicion of cheating. Because Jamal is from the slums of India and has no educational background, it seems entirely improbable if not impossible that Jamal could make it this far, but each question is connected with distinct and sometimes painful memories for Jamal. It's as if he is destined to win, even though he only went on the show to impress a girl he has loved his whole life, Latika.Danny Boyle (""28 Days Later,"" ""Sunshine"") takes us from memory to memory as Jamal advances question by question toward the million dollars. These memories offer vivid insight into poverty in India as well as the lives of Jamal, Latika and Jamal's older brother Salim. As children they are left parentless and taught how to swindle tourists, leading to lives of little fulfillment or even corruption. Despite being separated, Jamal and Latika are reunited several times and in fact Jamal's only motivation in life is his love for her.While the young, unknown, Indian actors are absolutely amazing in this film, the biggest kudos go to director Boyle, who creates an astonishing film. For Boyle to go from science fiction and zombie thrillers to taking on a project as daring and unusual as ""Slumdog Millionaire"" proves that he's not only a brave director, but a versatile one. His great success with making this film intense, eye-opening and full of heart all at the same time prove that he's also an incredible one. ""Slumdog"" is just the beginning for Boyle who might be one of the most progressive and talented directors working today.It's hard to be completely blown away by a film whose core message is about destiny and leans on the fact that Jamal is simply fated to do this well in explaining what has unfolded, but like any good film ought to, Boyle makes you a fan of the characters and not care as much about the logistics as you might normally do. The fact that this film starts out so dramatic and real makes it hard to embrace the fairytale it blossoms into, but it's the great visual storytelling along the way that makes it so enjoyable. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com/",sadness

"I am fed up with this movie getting bad reviews.As far as performances go: Zach Cregger was phenomenal. His acting ability exceeds that of the average big name actor in this industry. And if you can prove yourself to be a good actor in a road trip sex comedy, then that's a pretty big accomplishment if you ask me. When he needs to be funny he's hilarious. When he needs to be serious, he's completely nonchalant. Every detail of his tone and expressions are immediately recognized by the audience, and he does a good job of not being cocky about it. Not to mention this is only his second film.Trevor Moore did a fantastic comedic job. Most critics call him a ""Jim Carrey wannabe,"" which is a joke. For one thing, Jim Carrey never wrote and directed anything I've ever seen. Also, Carrey has the annoying tendency to over act. For some reason he has this idea that the more over the top and exaggerated you act, the funnier your character will be. I disagree. That's just underestimating the intelligence of your audience. It is clear that Trevor Moore has a natural awareness of when to tone it down, and when to raise things up. And of course, he has this signature bug-eyed expression and fluctuation of the voice that will make any line ten times funnier.When you put the two men together, you get Eugene and Tucker; characters with a surprisingly heart-warming chemistry. Unlike most movies, you see throughout this story that these two friends really, truly care about each other. Sure, they have opposite points of view, and it can be a real chore to have to deal with one another, but they remain best friends through it all. The writers did an excellent job displaying their devotion. Which answers the question that I often ask when I watch movies like ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Wedding Crashers,"" which is, ""If they can't stand each other, why are they even friends?""The movie is oozing originality, which most critics have decided to overlook when they heard the words ""two boys"" and ""road trip."" The typical sex comedy usually makes the protagonist the straight man, and his nutty friend tends to have all the bad luck. However this movie has the role of the protagonist shared between both the straight man and the nutty friend. Both characters learn a lesson, both characters develop throughout the movie, and both characters get ""the girl."" They also did a good job of consistently being a comedy, and not getting lost in the romance, which movies (mainly featuring the ""Frat Pack"") tend to do. Not to mention, how many times do you see a conservative, pro-abstinent lead in a movie like this? Isn't it usually just two horny boys trying to get laid? The character Eugene, or the ""straight man,"" also rebelled against the stereotypes by not being afraid to look stupid. In most movies, characters like him are lovable, nearly flawless, and hated by almost no one. Here, Eugene was scaring children, pooping on floors, flashing a gas station, and pissing off a famous rapper. FINALLY a protagonist that knows how to get EMBARRASSED.The movie also makes the audience take another look at Playboy. Instead of viewing it as a trashy magazine that exploits women, it is portrayed as a celebration of how beautiful women can be.I gave the movie an 8, simply because it wasn't their idea to make the movie about a road trip to the Playboy mansion, and I know they are capable of producing something golden.I've recommended this movie to everyone I know. It has enough ""aww"" moments to take your girlfriend or boyfriend to, and enough buddy-buddy moments to take your best friend to as well.I hope after reading this, movie-goers will give the film a chance, and ignore all the thoughtless, inaccurate reviews that completely bash it.",sadness
"I'ts finally here.I have been waiting for this movie for almost 30 years, could not for the life of me understand why it was hidden.At the time that I saw the movie The Disco movement was still part of our lives, this movie had its following, the music alone was amazing and has stayed with me in my memory for all these years.Back in 1978 I bought the musical soundtrack album from the movie ,I even bought the paperback novel with pictures from the movie in it, which I still have, because back then we could not buy the movie.Unfortunately my record was stolen out of its cover at a party but I still have the cover. Now I can finally sit down and relive being a twenty year old again.

"Queen Latifah shows us everything she's got in Just Wright, a charming romantic comedy about finding true love right in front of you. Just Wright is about Leslie Wright, a physical therapist who is also a massive basketball fan and so, when she gets the opportunity to become Scott McKnight's physical therapist, she is over the moon. The only thing is, Leslie wants their relationship to be more than professional, however her cousin Morgan wants to be a wife to any basketball player and her eyes are on Scott. So as you would expect, Just Wright is yet another predictable and cliché romantic comedy, however this is different as this is actually very enjoyable. The greatest quality about the movie is the story. Even though it's predictable from the first sixty seconds of the movie and had many rom-com clichés, it doesn't spoil the movie because the story was just very charming and is one of those heart-warming stories that will make you smile all the time. This isn't one of your usual Zellwegger romantic comedies where a ditzy woman falls in love with her perfect guy who she clapped eyes on in the first minute and slapstick comedy ensues. This is about a professional relationship growing into friendship growing into something more without the use of the woman falling over every ten seconds or getting out her over-sized knickers to get laughs, which is another quality I loved about Just Wright. The comedy used in Just Wright is basically through charm, the lines that Queen Latifah and Common's characters use can make you giggle in some parts. The acting was good and was a massive strength of the movie and Queen Latifah and Common stand out from the entire cast with their marvellous performances as their characters. The chemistry between Queen Latifah and Comm0n was brilliant and very believable.The characters were written well and they actually had personalities, which is a little unusual to see in romantic comedies considering that most rom-coms have one-dimensional personalities. Just Wright really should have sunk with the very predictable story and the romantic-comedy clichés but writer Michael Elliot and director Sanaa Hamri have made it work and have both done a great job on this movie, you can tell the attention has been put into it. The movie might be predictable but it works because of the charm and the likable leads. Queen Latifah and Common both have done a great job in playing their characters and adding charm to the movie. Some people may think Just Wright is another one of those movies that mixes predictable romantic-comedies with sport and while they might be right, the movie is much more than that. With charming performances and a good story along with it, this beats quite a few movies in its genre.I don't have anything bad to say about Just Wright, it's one of those movies that's good to watch because of it's nice and charming story and characters. Also, another thing that I loved about Just Wright is the fact that the leads are different to the usual characters you see in romantic-comedy movies and shows that love comes in all shapes and sizes, which was a nice change to see. Overall, this is a good little movie to see and not take seriously. It's very predictable and you'll more than likely guess everything within the first minute of the movie but it's such a charming movie and the story is a good story to follow. If you like Queen Latifah as an actress, then you need to watch this as she gives out a very good performance. This is definitely different to the other romantic-comedies that you see today and it's a welcoming change. To those who plan on making romantic-comedy movies, take a leaf out of this movie's book as the film was what the movie title suggests.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",sadness

"""Take a lap!"" ""Set of 10!""With a name like W-o-o-d-c-o-c-k (roll it off your tongue slowly for maximum effect), you'd have expect the jokes to come fast and furious about the appendage. Well there are, however, the best parts of Mr Woodcock are not the sexual innuendos, but come from the various gymnasium scenes, where Jasper Woodcock (Billy Bob Thorton) the PE teacher runs his classes like a sadistic drill sergeant, and all the misfits tremble in fear and loathe as he puts them through the paces, with physical, mental and emotional abuse dished out in deadpan manner. The filmmakers know this, and set the bar high enough from the get go, but only for the movie to spiral in the general southwards direction.Thirteen years after his unforgettable years of growing up under Mr Woodcock's insults, John Farley (Seann William Scott) becomes a renowned self help guru and published a bestseller called ""Letting Go: How to Get Past Your Past"", because it takes one successful loser to teach the rest how to move on. During a journey back home where you're hit with a barrage of literally corny jokes, John realizes to his horror that his mother Beverly (Susan Sarandon) is now dating Mr Woodcock, and he makes it his mission to dissuade her from giving him a new stepdad, one who has been the bane of his childhood.That basically becomes the premise of the movie, and a highly predictable one at that. You'll see from a mile away every conceivable plot development coming toward you, and it doesn't help that the short run time of under 90 minutes probably meant some material were reserved for the DVD release. You can tell by some of the continuity errors, helped in no part by John's bad haircut episode.Billy Bob Thorton owns the movie as Woodcock, delivery his deliciously acidic remarks with aplomb. Alpha-male type roles are nothing new to Thorton, and bullying or whipping losers to shape are part of the game, just like School for Scoundrels. And here he plays the unapologetic teacher with EQ problems, taking perverse delight in seeing his charges suffer. Sean William Scott is better known unfortunately for his loud and over the top Stifler from the American Pie movies, but given a rather muted character like John Farley, he fades away quicker than you can spell l-o-s-e-r. Susan Sarandon rounds up the lead cast as the woman caught between two men, and frankly I thought it was like an extension of her mother's role in Elizabethtown. Look out for more Sarandon in an upcoming movie called Enchanted, which takes the mickey out of a Disney movie. Most of the other supporting cast like Amy Poehler and Ethan Suplee got wasted, with the former being a self-professed alcoholic Barbie doll, while the other a fanatic who had read John's book 900 times and counting.Mr Woodcock isn't laugh out loud or laugh a minute, but it has its moments. Sadly, most of the best bits made their way to the trailers, making the movie seem like an empty shell. And given the editing fiasco of late, Mr Woodcock suffers from censorship too, with what I thought was just verbal expressions of ecstasy being snipped off and left on the cutting room floor. Pity.",sadness

"Firstly, ignore these stupid reviews: if your highest idea of film is a typical brainless Hollywood structure with the inciting incident, setback, climax and happy ending - as i suspect the reviewers so far hold - you will be disappointed. And good riddance. The less we have of this mindless, brainwashed notion that every film should conform to a 120-min clichéd set of min-by-min peaks and troughs, the better.It's only 75mins instead of 120mins? Boo hoo. It doesn't have a happy ending? Shut up. It doesn't have your stupid clichéd ""plot"" structure you get in every film? Waaah, waah, waah.If that's the basis of your criticism, it's not the writers to blame: it's you. You, the viewer, are an idiot.I experimented with this on Netflix as a wildcard watch, despite the cheap, smutty cover which does it a horrendous disservice. I was genuinely surprised and heartened by what i discovered in it. And you know it's done well when your chest hurts afterwards. The film is absolutely carried by Lindsay Burdge, who gives an unbelievably sincere, empathetic, moving, and sensitive performance: one of the best i've seen in years for an indie flick. I say that as someone who works in film every day, and who forwarded the piece on to a few people as a classic example of first-class artistry. The supporting cast are perfectly reasonable, although perhaps the male counterpart is slightly implausibly mature - it ultimately countermands the relationship to make it more sympathetic.The story is essentially of one woman's descent into obsession and madness, laced over a very tense and awkward contrasting ascent of tension and difficulty: it's touch-sensitive stuff, with a strange quality that does very much keep you involved with the heavy air of tension. I suspect the writer was tempted to tone it down; the Shakespearian touch would have done well here: a murder at the end of it, or some vile, terrifying conspiracy to really anchor it down. The sex scenes are erotic, tastefully filmed, and coarsely authentic.I'd compare the subtlety of it to ""Notes on a Scandal"" (2006) with Judi Dench: centred around an apparently harmless female lead, who sinks under the weight of her increasing needs and compulsions. If one theme emerges, it's the idea of loneliness: you can *feel* the loneliness of the character; coldly alone in her apartment, emotionally isolated, foolishly childish, and of course, hopelessly naive. It's not event-driven per se, and that's absolutely fine, no matter what the idiot i-want-bruce- willis-don't-make-me-think hoard says. It's a character-driven piece, and a refreshing internal look at an alternative side where the apparent sexual predator is the fool. We don't find out how it happened, why, or where it concluded, and we don't need to - it's showing us the world from her point of view, which is ambiguous, convoluted, and blinded.The sad point about a title like this is that the marketing and distribution people clearly dumped it, and it may unjustifiably disappear into the ether. It needs a better cover, maybe an HBO slot, a different sales angle, and a more agreeable pickup team.If you're one of those idiots who watch something like this and whinge that it's not a usual, familiar Hollywood-style happy-ended turd, please do the rest of the world a favor and just throw yourself off a bridge. Stick to comic book movies and stuff about jaded ex-law enforcement types killing TheTerrorists (TM). You're the reason interesting little pieces like this drop down the list, when they should be moving upwards on it.",sadness

"There's a chance you may like this, in which case I don't really want to taint your expectations with the things that follow. If you like whimsical fantasy and tend to like everything you watch, then don't read on. If you have some taste and a good sense of judgement, then you'll certainly be irked by the film's problems. Its tonally uneven - towards the beginning, it mixes dry office based observational humour with slapstick action scenes. It works for a while, but then changes tone completely about a third in. Now its trying to be meaningful and spirited, but it doesn't quite work. Its still too fantastical to be taken seriously. Some scenes towards the end are so long and boring, lacking any humour or emotional punches whatsoever that you'll find yourself suddenly snapping and thinking ""hey, what's going on here? What am I watching here?""The film uses fantasy daydreams as a plot device, but then after about a third of the way through, drops them completely. They're barely referred to again. Yet, the rest of the film contains elements so fantastical, whimsical and absurd that you WISH he was still daydreaming. Except he isn't. It feels really jarring, and you beg that he snaps out of a daydream so that the film isn't so ludicrous. So many things happen which are absurd. Cell phone calls whilst he's climbing up the Himalayas, having been travelling for days by this point. Flies at the drop of a hat, with just his briefcase, then has an endless supply of clothes and appropriate gear. Hasn't been or done anything interesting but is suddenly an expert skateboarder. He jumps into a helicopter being dangerously piloted by a drunkard, based on some fantasy encouragement by one of his daydreams. What kind of message is that? Live your life! Be reckless! Do dangerous things whilst drunk! Your friend drink at the bar all night? Hey, live you life, let them drive you home! His motives are never really clear. He goes to search for a lost negative from a photographer - because he wants to a) travel or b) keep his job? If a), then he could have picked plenty more goals and destinations, and the drive to start now isn't particularly strong. If b) then there are plenty of other ways to do it, and it makes no sense (he could have just said the negative was missing from the package). His personality is never really explained. He processes incredible photographs for a renowned international magazine, yet hasn't been or done anything interesting at all in his life? If his imagination was that active for his day dreams, then surely he'd have put it to better use by now? And if he has some huge fear barrier to making decisions (as shown in the opening scene) then why? Whats the emotional truth here, and how will he resolve it? Its never answered - but when he does finally go travelling, he experiences no fear at all (except for a stupid scene where he literally fights with a shark).The message of the film seems to be ""make your life more interesting, and do things, so that the opposite sex will find you more attractive"". This is a really superficial, shame based message, the complete opposite of films which imply ""be liked for who you are, not for what you do or can provide for people"". Ben Stiller plays it pretty dry and wooden, without expressing much emotion at all. I can't remember him laughing, looking sad, scared, exhilarated, nothing. Even when skateboarding down a mountain, he has the same facial expression. His lack of emotion throughout makes it hard to really engage with the character or care at all about this fantastical adventure he's supposedly going on. Sean Penn's acting is, as ever, fantastic, but feels like it really doesn't belong in this film. By the end, it feels like a massive advert for eHarmony.It also feels like a very bad imitation of the much superior film Joe Vs The Volcano.",sadness
"First off, if you are looking for shoot 'em up, space ship flying through the stars, hunting aliens type of science fiction, don't even bother with this film. If you are looking for a Science Fiction film that explores the human condition in the way that Blade Runner, 2001: A Space Odyssey or Contact does, then this is right up your alley.This film is not about events and actions, it's about ideas and concepts. People looking for plot points to move them along will be bored to death with this film because most of the action of this film are those that will happen in your head. It is about people, desires, regrets and what we would be willing to do if we could have that one thing we cannot have back.Some people complain about the fact that Clooney's character of Chris does very little psychiatric work in this film. But, the truth of the matter is that his occupation is used more to propel his anti-faith views. I haven't seen it mentioned, but there is a reason why there are a lot of discussion about God, religion and faith in this film.Throughout the film, Chris questions and belittles Rheya's religious views, seeing the idea of putting stock in something that he sees as fantasy as being useless and just a crutch for people deluding themselves into a happiness based on illusion. Chris comes to realize that he would give up anything to be with Rheya, whether being with her is an illusion or not. His happiness depends on her, and he realizes that accepting what he needs is not a weakness -- as accepting faith is not a weakness -- it is simply a choice to fulfill one's life, whether it be real or illusion. And, as philosophers would argue, who can really say which is which?For those who want a science fiction film to make you think (like Blade Runner does), this film is it. With a tremendous cast, beautiful production design, excellent direction, and one of the best film scores in recent years (hats off to Cliff Martinez), I have no trouble recommending this film to anybody who is in the need of an intelligent, thought-provoking film.",sadness

"As a fan of Jane Fonda's acting, I was mildly interested in seeing this movie, her first in many years. I wish now that I hadn't wasted my time.Granted, Jane Fonda is an asset to ""Monster-in-Law."" She brims with radiance and plays the Viola role with tremendous flair (although the psychosis of her character sometimes seems forced and exaggerated). My favorite scene, actually, is when she flies off the handle and tries to strangle a young singer whom she is interviewing on her talk show. There are a few moments where she effectively conveys the insecurity and desperation beneath Viola's nasty exterior. Nonetheless, even a brilliant actress cannot save a movie with such a weak script.Take, for instance, the first few scenes, when Charlie and Kevin meet (in a most whimsical fashion, may I add). This introduction seems too drawn-out and ultimately worthless to the plot. I found myself mentally tuning out for the sake of my sanity.Speaking of the two lovers, I'd be hard-pressed to name a more boring on-screen couple. J-Lo, as has been mentioned frequently on this site, comes across as too sweet and innocent and perfect throughout most of the movie. Simply put, she's annoying. I kept wishing they could have cast a more watchable actress. The Kevin character, also, has zero substance and is bland. He is like a prop that they casually drag into the movie whenever they need some filler between Charlie/Viola catfights.Wanda Sykes, as Viola's assistant, is fairly comical and works much better with Jane Fonda than J-Lo does. Viola's mother-in-law also delivers her lines in an entertainingly caustic way. However, these two women do not have much screen time at all.""Monster-in-Law"" progresses as a string of loosely connected arguments. The result is tedious and mundane. There is no climax, really. If you've seen one spat between Charlie and Viola, you've seen them all. They spew petty insults...they seek revenge on each other...they go on to the next scene and repeat it all over again. It might be juicy if it weren't so repetitive, and if a different actress were squaring off against Jane Fonda, and if the dialogue weren't quite so stale.The ending is literally an embarrassment. Oh, I won't give it away...except to say that I felt as if I were watching the end of a ""Full House"" episode. Yes folks, the music and lines are THAT corny and predictable. By the way, this is not a central plot point by any means, but Charlie's bridal gown is not particularly flattering. More like flattening. It makes her look as if she has no chest at all! Anyhow, I would not recommend this fluffy, somewhat empty movie, which hardly evoked a laugh or even a smile from me. If you still want to see it, go ahead, but definitely don't expect too much. I saw this movie just a couple of hours ago and have already forgotten about most of it. Not that I'm complaining.",sadness
"I suspect MOST people who like this movie so much do so because they are fans of ballet. Those who are not fans are simply much less likely to watch it. I DON'T care for ballet, so I felt a little odd watching it. I know the movie has a fabulous reputation and there was a lot of good in it, but I used the DVD remote to speed through the long ballet scenes! I know, that makes me a Neanderthal, BUT considering MOST people probably feel about the same way about ballet, this review is intended for those people--not the die-hard fans! Okay--half the movie or so is ballet, so automatically it CAN'T be a great movie to some. But, what did I like? Well, the cinematography was gorgeous for 1948 and the acting was generally first-rate. But, the ending of the movie was a letdown because it seemed a bit silly and overwrought. Plus, I was REALLY hoping someone would punch that really pompous producer (Boris Lermontov) in the nose instead--now THAT would have been a great ending! So, in conclusion, if you LOVE ballet, this movie will make you go nuts because it is so wonderful.

There were many times when the theater full of people burst into laughter, and I even found myself crying at some points I was laughing so hard! The actors all do a fantastic job with their parts, and you can easily identify with most of them. (No ""over the top"" characters ever do a hostile takeover of the plot.) This movie is probably a notch below movies like ""The Hangover,"" ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" and ""Wedding Crashers,"" but it definitely holds it own and you will most definitely find yourself laughing hard more than once.

It moved at a good pace until the end, it had some twists, and still left room for a bit of comedy. With one glaring exception the actors were all pretty good. That exception is the girl that our hero was psychically linked with, her delivery was flat and I just overall think she could have done a better job. All in all though, I recommend this.

"Just discovered this today, on Hulu, 6 years after it was made. What a find! Important Note: in the critically important ""me too"" era, it is essential to mention that although both student and teacher are consenting, there is an imbalance/abuse of power and authority. No matter what, the teacher is to blame.
That being said, what a phenomenal performance by the female lead! The nuance, the things unsaid, the running, the empty lost stares, the complete inability to connect. Even with herself.
The nod to mental illness. The sophistication of not telling us exactly what was wrong. Just silent witnesses to a young woman (feeling old) drowning. For her the affair/connection/owning was essential-perhaps even shocking herself at its importance.
Self destructive-she's so self destructive. Why? We will never know (can we really know anyone?). The anguish is real. Clinging to him like her life depends on it-and perhaps it does-we are not privy to the ending beyond her hiding out in a lonely hotel in the fetal position.
I differ with other reviewers regarding the male student however. I feel they did a great job depicting him as age appropriate regarding brain development-impulsivity, lack of consequences, conquest, and perhaps truly enthralled with her-until she became too needy-to the point of mania. His attempts at trying to understand her are heartbreaking-he really tries as far as he is able. But how can he ever be expected to understand the complexities of a grown women with mental health issues that are not treated or resolved? He ultimately does not have the tools to deal with that/her. A tragic love story, or lust story, with madness and passion and heartbreak.",sadness

On the face of it, a lot can go wrong when you have too many actors and too many parallel stories to deal with. But to Marshall's credit he does a decent job of getting them all together. The actors are the best thing about this film. I fell in love with Jennifer Garner all over again. Ashton Kutcher, Topher Grace, Anne Hathway and Jamie Foxx aren't bad either. Kathy Bates is there for 2 scenes, I wonder if she even deserves a credit. But the fact is, small stories are effectively brought together to affirm the fact that falling in love is perhaps the warmest feeling in the world. It's great; the movie doesn't bother raising insights and asking questions of you. It just tells you that thank god we all fall in love. Its sweet.",sadness
"If you are looking for a fun experience at the movie theater with the family, friends, or just yourself, Kicking and Screaming will provide it. If you are looking for Old School or Anchorman, wait and see something else. Kicking and Screaming is more of a family movie with lessons to be learned (by people of all ages!), but fans of Will Ferrell will not be disappointed. Those who appreciate the utter wackiness and comic brilliance of Ferrell will come out of Kicking and Screaming satisfied. The Ferrell of Kicking and Screaming is different than the actor's previous films. He plays the role of father and son, and plays it beautifully. You will be amazed at some of the things that come out of his mouth and the things that he does. Without spoiling the movie or giving away any of the priceless lines, walkaway from this review knowing that you will get good comedy and a fun experience for everyone. Highlights are Will Ferrell (a given) and Robert Duvall as Ferrell's father. Kudos to Mike Ditka as well. 7/10",sadness

"Cake is about finding out that however lofty your ideals maybe, you can always be wrong.This comedy, as all good Hollywood productions, starts by over doing the traits of its main character. At some point, her zealousness runs her into a wall and then the movie starts to be a bit more realistic, a bit more sensible.The story itself is simple, the plot elements unsurprising, and, even if the dialogs hold their own and are funny, they are uninventive.The big attraction of the movie is that it is entertaining, and it doesn't screw up. You'll spend a good evening if you're interested in seeing an over idealistic, over energized young woman make a mess of things and then save the day in true Hollywood fashion.",sadness

"This is the kind of ""horror"" movie that I like! Well ""horror""..it's not really scary, no violence (compared to SAW, HOSTEL, VACANCY, DESCENT etc.), not even gore (compared to EVID DEAD 2, BRAINDEAD etc.).So what is it? A marvelous movie with beautiful picture, sets, actors and special effects. Everything lies within the old fashioned climax, like a clever revival of HAMMER FILMS. It's as classy as Coppola's Dracula.. It's everything The Haunting (DeBont)and Wolfman (Johnston) failed to be. It reminds me of the good ""Woman in Black"" and ""Don't be Afraid of the Dark"", with Del Toro behind the camera.Well, Hammer lovers, Del Toro fans..just run to see this movie!",sadness
"""Aloha"" is the classic example of a film that bites off so much more than it can chew that it begins to choke early and all we can do is passively witness its inevitable cardiac arrest. The film takes elements from the romantic comedy, science-fiction, family drama, and comedy genres, but never finds a way to mesh them all into a package that's worth opening. As a result, what unfolds is a hybrid of pale plot-threads and exhausting scenarios that stretch the line of credulity ever-so thin that it becomes impossible to sympathize with the characters and believe their scenarios in any respect.What a shame too because this film squanders the screen writing and directorial talents of Cameron Crowe, along with actors like Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone, Alec Baldwin, Rachel McAdams, and Danny McBride, all of whom have proved themselves to be hugely commendable presences in a wide variety of roles. With ""Aloha,"" we focus on Cooper's Brian Gilcrest, a failed defense contractor, who is assigned to oversee the launch of a weapons satellite from Hawaii. This assignment comes with a potential precedent to militarize space, along with convincing Hawaiian natives that this launch would be beneficial for them in the long-run (in what way, I'm still trying to figure out). All of this is designed to benefit a multimillionaire named Carson Welch (Bill Murray in a role so empty that even he looks half asleep most of the time).Gilcrest is assigned to work with Allison Ng (Emma Stone), an Air Force pilot, in Hawaii for the meantime. Allison's energetic, often spunky personality gets under the skin of Gilcrest, a hardened cynic, who is also trying to reconnect with his ex-girlfriend Tracy (Rachel McAdams), who is now married to John (John Krasinski) with two kids. John is a cartoon of a character, never speaking in the presence of Brian and only exchanging ambiguous facial expressions and brotherly gestures (which take an explicitly corny turn at the very end of the film). As the inevitable, cosmic forces would have it, however, eventually, Gilcrest takes a liking to Allison despite their personality differences, but his shady, workaholic tendencies will inevitably rub her the wrong way during the time of this crucial space launch that will leave them both ""steamrolled by the future"" as Gilcrest puts it.Explaining the juxtaposition of this brewing romance and this rocket launch into space is no easy task. Crowe seems dedicated to making two unrelated things connect in the most hackneyed way imaginable. Even when we are focused on the human characters, there's little human interest to pull us into their lives. Both Gilcrest and Allison speak like characters in a movie, always ready with a quip or some sort of slyly funny remark; never does Crowe penetrate the heart of this relationship, and instead, settles for digging holes around it hoping to strike something that will pull us, the audience, inwards.This, however, never comes to fruition. I felt like I was always sitting within arms length of ""Aloha,"" its incredulous situations, and its characters. The screen was several rows before me, and yet, no connection was ever formed. For as many characters, situations, and circumstances lie within this film's screenplay, this is a shockingly boring project, laboriously paced and only adequately acted, given there's no real challenging role for the talent here to sink into. The film persists on with a cloying sense of tone-deafness to the impossibility of its own situations that it treads Nicolas Sparks territory (although I say with a slight quiver in my voice that I liked ""The Longest Ride"" a tad more than this).Crowe's last film was ""We Bought a Zoo,"" which, like ""Aloha,"" had its share of emotionally manipulative elements. However, it was also a tad more watchable and light-hearted than this, and certainly a bit easier to believe in terms of its circumstances. With ""Aloha,"" we see Crowe test the very boundaries of love on an intergalactic scale, and after several films that have even questionably undermined his greatest achievements like ""Almost Famous"" and ""Say Anything...,"" maybe it's time for him to come back to Earth, wouldn't you say?",happiness

"I saw the pre-screening. I laughed twice so I'm giving it 2 stars. This movie makes you hate Stiller's character even though he is supposed to be the hero. He's creepy and a liar, yet he dates gorgeous women because they have no better options. Stiller comes across in typical Stiller fashion, with quirky behaviors and odd humor. The film tries to be light hearted but ends up being quite depressing and not believable. Only a socially dysfunctional audience will see this film as romantic. The audience that has learned to create positive relationships may walk out half way through.With a personality like that, Stiller's character would end up alone. Guaranteed.",happiness

"Look. To start off with this movie had no real character or character development. At least any that I payed attention to. The acting was below average, the actress playing Julia looks like she's about to pass out...... The whole movie! I could go on about other revenge horror flicks that could top this easily but let's face it if your at this point then your probably gonna watch this garbage anyway. That being said there were a couple of moments that could of had potential but the director just didn't make the grade. The soundtrack at times kinda filled in where the atmosphere was lacking but in the end I don't think even a full orchestra could have saved the end result.Bloody..... Yeah a little. Story...... Yeah a little. Acting..... Ummmm No. Overall Enjoyment..... Hell No.",happiness

"To be honest, I didn't expect this movie to have been as hated as it seems to be. It seems to have a high number of both 10/10s and 1/10s... as if you either love it or hate it? Well, I loved the fact that the movie distracted me enough to relax and unwind for an hour and a half. I didn't think it was groundbreaking, so originally I was going to give it 9/10, but also, I though it was very straightforward and plot twists are usually important parts of dramas and romantic comedies.The thing is, though; I've never expected romantic comedies to have very much story or be very heavy on plot. So, all I was looking for was something to occupy me... and I got it.There's not much else to say, except that I really don't think the movie was so bad that it deserves a 1/10. When you consider the genre, it was fairly average. Plus, ""blonde humor"" is funny, and I think that's why the girl-who-was-lucky was so silly: she was really not accustomed to thinking critically, relying on her good luck (i.e. a very positive, problem-free environment) to provide a platform for her success.",happiness

"I work with troubled teens and decided to invite a student over break to go to the movies with my 4 and 9 year old. He suggested ""Fat Albert""--I am so glad he did! The film was absolutely wonderful in its innocence and charm. My teen liked it because of the ""fantasy to reality"" twist...as well as the cute girls and the great music. He also liked the idea of someone looking out for the ""lonely"" kid. My little kids thought the jokes were funny, the guys were funny, the music and dancing were""the bomb"" and even the plot was even a little suspenseful for a little kid. I loved it because I grew up on the ""Fat Albert"" series and was just so happy to see and instantly remember all of my old pals. And the hilarious group scenes where the actions so fundamental to the cartoon were just ridiculous to the real life settings were so clever and delightfully funny--I was so pleased! If you're looking for an all-around, no crass or innuendo laden, truly sweet family film--this is the one!!",happiness
"I did watch the whole movie. The filmmakers tried to create a spiritual documentary without any understanding of foreign cultures and traditions. The result is a pathetic and very shallow bunch of scenes. It's like posting random images with 'deep' quotes on Facebook. The movie is heavily targeted on average uneducated narrow-minded people. That's too bad many people will get some scenes totally wrong because they just do not know the story of a certain place/people and just see a picture presented with a certain ""message"". Sad truth is - it seems that the director also got those scenes wrong. I say go watch some real documentaries, read books and travel.",happiness

"I think this movie was a great depiction of the original cartoon.  The humor used in the film is very much like what would be found in cartoons, and is designed to be taken that way.  I mean, any show where the narrator and the characters actually interact should not be treated/rated the same way as, say, a movie with dirty-humor.  This really seems like it was designed both for children and for adults who remember the original cartoon, and I feel that it capticated these ideas very well and also captured the hearts of teens who secretly love cartoons but didn't want to be caught in a cartoon-ish movie theatre.  I say that it was a great job all around, and that the acting very accurately fit the characters as well, in that cartoonish type way...a hard thing to do, but they pulled it off.",happiness

"Nothing so true as what you once let fall,""Most Women have no Characters at all.""Matter too soft a lasting mark to bear,And best distinguish'd by black, brown, or fair.     How many pictures of one nymph we view,All how unlike each other, all how true!Arcadia's Countess, here, in ermin'd pride,Is, there, Pastora by a fountain side.Here Fannia, leering on her own good man,And there, a naked Leda with a Swan.Let then the Fair one beautifully cry,In Magdalen's loose hair and lifted eye,Or dress'd in smiles of sweet Cecilia shine,With simp'ring angels, palms, and harps divine;Whether the charmer sinner it, or saint it,If folly grows romantic, I must paint it.     Come then, the colours and the ground prepare!Dip in the rainbow, trick her off in air;Choose a firm cloud, before it fall, and in itCatch, ere she change, the Cynthia of this minute.     Rufa, whose eye quick-glancing o'er the park,Attracts each light gay meteor of a spark,Agrees as ill with Rufa studying Locke,As Sappho's diamonds with her dirty smock;Or Sappho at her toilet's greasy task,With Sappho fragrant at an ev'ning Masque:So morning insects that in muck begun,Shine, buzz, and flyblow in the setting sun.     How soft is Silia! fearful to offend;The frail one's advocate, the weak one's friend:To her, Calista prov'd her conduct nice,And good Simplicius asks of her advice.Sudden, she storms! she raves! You tip the wink,But spare your censure; Silia does not drink.All eyes may see from what the change arose,All eyes may see—a pimple on her nose.     Papillia, wedded to her doating spark,Sighs for the shades—""How charming is a park!""A park is purchas'd, but the fair he seesAll bath'd in tears—""Oh, odious, odious trees!""     Ladies, like variegated tulips, show,'Tis to their changes that their charms they owe;Their happy spots the nice admirer take,Fine by defect, and delicately weak.'Twas thus Calypso once each heart alarm'd,Aw'd without virtue, without beauty charm'd;Her tongue bewitch'd as oddly as her eyes,Less wit than mimic, more a wit than wise;Strange graces still, and stranger flights she had,Was just not ugly, and was just not mad;Yet ne'er so sure our passion to create,As when she touch'd the brink of all we hate.     Narcissa's nature, tolerably mild,To make a wash, would hardly stew a child;Has ev'n been prov'd to grant a lover's pray'r,And paid a tradesman once to make him stare,Gave alms at Easter, in a Christian trim,And made a widow happy, for a whim.Why then declare good nature is her scorn,When 'tis by that alone she can be borne?Why pique all mortals, yet affect a name?A fool to pleasure, yet a slave to fame:Now deep in Taylor and the Book of MartyrsNow drinking citron with his Grace and Chartres.Now conscience chills her, and now passion burns;And atheism and religion take their turns;A very heathen in the carnal part,Yet still a sad, good Christian at her heart.     See Sin in State, majestically drunk;Proud as a peeress, prouder as a punk;Chaste to her husband, frank to all beside,A teeming mistress, but a barren bride.What then? let blood and body bear the fault,Her head's untouch'd, that noble seat of thought:Such this day's doctrine—in another fitShe sins with poets through pure love of wit.What has not fir'd her bosom or her brain?Caesar and Tallboy, Charles and Charlema'ne.As Helluo, late dictator of the feast,The nose of hautgout, and the tip of taste,Critiqu'd your wine, and analys'd your meat,Yet on plain pudding deign'd at home to eat;So Philomede, lect'ring all mankindOn the soft passion, and the taste refin'd,Th' address, the delicacy—stoops at once,And makes her hearty meal upon a dunce.     Flavia's a wit, has too much sense to pray,To Toast our wants and wishes, is her way;Nor asks of God, but of her stars to giveThe mighty blessing, ""while we live, to live.""Then all for death, that opiate of the soul!Lucretia's dagger, Rosamonda's bowl.Say, what can cause such impotence of mind?A spark too fickle, or a spouse too kind.Wise wretch! with pleasures too refin'd to please;With too much spirit to be e'er at ease;With too much quickness ever to be taught;With too much thinking to have common thought:You purchase pain with all that joy can give,And die of nothing but a rage to live.     Turn then from wits; and look on Simo's mate,No ass so meek, no ass so obstinate:Or her, that owns her faults, but never mends,Because she's honest, and the best of friends:Or her, whose life the Church and scandal share,For ever in a passion, or a prayer:Or her, who laughs at Hell, but (like her Grace)Cries, ""Ah! how charming, if there's no such place!""Or who in sweet vicissitude appearsOf mirth and opium, ratafie and tears,The daily anodyne, and nightly draught,To kill those foes to fair ones, time and thought.Woman and fool are two hard things to hit,For true no-meaning puzzles more than wit.     But what are these to great Atossa's mind?Scarce once herself, by turns all womankind!Who, with herself, or others, from her birthFinds all her life one warfare upon earth:Shines, in exposing knaves, and painting fools,Yet is, whate'er she hates and ridicules.No thought advances, but her eddy brainWhisks it about, and down it goes again.Full sixty years the world has been her trade,The wisest fool much time has ever made.From loveless youth to unrespected age,No passion gratified except her rage.So much the fury still outran the wit,The pleasure miss'd her, and the scandal hit.Who breaks with her,-provokes revenge from Hell,But he's a bolder man who dares be well.Her every turn with violence pursu'd,Nor more a storm her hate than gratitude.To that each passion turns, or soon or late;love, if it makes her yield, must make her hate:Superiors? death! and equals? what a curse!But an inferior not dependant? worse.Offend her, and she knows not to forgive;Oblige her, and she'll hate you while you live:But die, and she'll adore you—Then the BustAnd Temple rise—then fall again to dust.Last night, her Lord was all that's good and great;A knave this morning, and his will a cheat.Strange! by the means defeated of the ends,By spirit robb'd of pow'r, by warmth of friends,By wealth of follow'rs! without one distressSick of herself through very selfishness!Atossa, curs'd with ev'ry granted pray'r,Childless with all her children, wants an heir.To heirs unknown descends th' unguarded store,Or wanders, heav'n-directed, to the poor.     Pictures like these, dear Madam, to design,Asks no firm hand, and no unerring line;Some wand'ring touch or some reflected light,Some flying stroke alone can hit 'em right:For how should equal colours do the knack?Chameleons who can paint in white and black?     ""Yet Chloe sure was form'd without a spot""—Nature in her then err'd not, but forgot.""With ev'ry pleasing, ev'ry prudent part,Say, what can Chloe want?""—She wants a heart.She speaks, behaves, and acts just as she ought;But never, never, reach'd one gen'rous thought.Virtue she finds too painful an endeavour,Content to dwell in decencies for ever.So very reasonable, so unmov'd,As never yet to love, or to be lov'd.She, while her lover pants upon her breast,Can mark the figures on an Indian chest;And when she sees her friend in deep despair,Observes how much a chintz exceeds mohair.Forbid it heav'n, a favour or a debtShe e'er should cancel—but she may forget.Safe is your secret still in Chloe's ear;But none of Chloe's shall you ever hear.Of all her dears she never slander'd one,But cares not if a thousand are undone.Would Chloe know if you're alive or dead?She bids her footman put it in her head.Chloe is prudent—would you too be wise?Then never break your heart when Chloe dies.     One certain portrait may (I grant) be seen,Which Heav'n has varnish'd out, and made a  Queen :The same for ever! and describ'd by allWith truth and goodness, as with crown and ball.Poets heap virtues, painters gems at will,And show their zeal, and hide their want of skill.'Tis well—but, artists! who can paint or write,To draw the naked is your true delight.That robe of quality so struts and swells,None see what parts of nature it conceals.Th' exactest traits of body or of mind,We owe to models of an humble kind.If Queensbury to strip there's no compelling,'Tis from a handmaid we must take a Helen.From peer or bishop 'tis no easy thingTo draw the man who loves his God, or King:Alas! I copy (or my draught would fail)From honest Mah'met, or plain Parson Hale.     But grant, in public men sometimes are shown,A woman's seen in private life alone:Our bolder talents in full light display'd;Your virtues open fairest in the shade.Bred to disguise, in public 'tis you hide;There, none distinguish twixt your shame or pride,Weakness or delicacy; all so nice,That each may seem a virtue, or a vice.     In men, we various ruling passions find;In women, two almost divide the kind;Those, only fix'd, they first or last obey,The love of pleasure, and the love of sway.That, Nature gives; and where the lesson taughtIs still to please, can pleasure seem a fault?Experience, this; by man's oppression curs'd,They seek the second not to lose the first.     Men, some to bus'ness, some to pleasure take;But ev'ry woman is at heart a rake:Men, some to quiet, some to public strife;But ev'ry Lady would be queen for life.     Yet mark the fate of a whole sex of queens!Pow'r all their end, but beauty all the means.In youth they conquer, with so wild a rage,As leaves them scarce a subject in their age:For foreign glory, foreign joy, they roam;No thought of peace or happiness at home.But wisdom's triumph is well-tim'd retreat,As hard a science to the fair as great!Beauties, like tyrants, old and friendless grown,Yet hate repose, and dread to be alone,Worn out in public, weary ev'ry eye,Nor leave one sigh behind them when they die.     Pleasures the sex, as children birds, pursue,Still out of reach, yet never out of view;Sure, if they catch, to spoil the toy at most,To covet flying, and regret when lost:At last, to follies youth could scarce defend,It grows their age's prudence to pretend;Asham'd to own they gave delight before,Reduc'd to feign it, when they give no more:As hags hold sabbaths, less for joy than spite,So these their merry, miserable night;Still round and round the ghosts of beauty glide,And haunt the places where their honour died.     See how the world its veterans rewards!A youth of frolics, an old age of cards;Fair to no purpose, artful to no end,Young without lovers, old without a friend,A fop their passion, but their prize a sot,Alive, ridiculous, and dead, forgot!     Ah, Friend! to dazzle let the vain design,To raise the thought and touch the heart, be thine!That charm shall grow, while what fatigues the Ring,Flaunts and goes down, an unregarded thing:So when the sun's broad beam has tir'd the sight,All mild ascends the moon's more sober light,Serene in virgin modesty she shines,And unobserv'd the glaring orb declines.     Oh! blest with temper, whose unclouded rayCan make tomorrow cheerful as today;She, who can love a sister's charms, or hearSighs for a daughter with unwounded ear;She, who ne'er answers till a husband cools,Or, if she rules him, never shows she rules;Charms by accepting, by submitting sways,Yet has her humour most, when she obeys;Let fops or fortune fly which way they will;Disdains all loss of tickets, or codille;Spleen, vapours, or smallpox, above them all,And mistress of herself, though China fall.     And yet, believe me, good as well as ill,Woman's at best a contradiction still.Heav'n, when it strives to polish all it canIts last best work, but forms a softer man;Picks from each sex, to make the fav'rite blest,Your love of pleasure, our desire of rest:Blends, in exception to all gen'ral rules,Your taste of follies, with our scorn of fools:Reserve with frankness, art with truth allied,Courage with softness, modesty with pride,Fix'd principles, with fancy ever new;Shakes all together, and produces—You.     Be this a woman's fame: with this unblest,Toasts live a scorn, and queens may die a jest.This Phoebus promis'd (I forget the year)When those blue eyes first open'd on the sphere;Ascendant Phoebus watch'd that hour with care,Averted half your parents' simple pray'r,And gave you beauty, but denied the pelfWhich buys your sex a tyrant o'er itself.The gen'rous God, who wit and gold refines,And ripens spirits as he ripens mines,Kept dross for duchesses, the world shall know it,To you gave sense, good humour, and a poet.",happiness
"jack nicholson used to be such a fantastic intriguing actor. It's hard to watch him plummet to such lows. He was always so amazing as intriguing, odd characters. One Flew..., The Shining, Five Easy Pieces, The Passenger, Witches of Eastwick...Something's.. is not a film to watch if you want to see Nicholson shine. He will always be a great actor in my eyes, but he was wasted in this film. None of his quirky qualities, oddball behaviour, or intriguing Jackness were given space to shine in this hollow shell of a movie.This movie tries so hard to please the audience, is racked with clichés and is, quite frankly, embarrassing for all involved.The crying scene is indeed embarrassing and way too over the top. The Paris sequence is so so so cliché, and the bridge over the river Seine ending... wow. how cliché can you get?Sure, some of the scenes were OK. Keanu wasn't as wooden as I've seen him in previous attempts at acting, but he still gave me splinters. Somebody else said this was the performance of Keaton's career. Annie Hall, anyone? Not only is AH a great performance, but a great film; far far far better than this one. I appreciate that the filmmaker is trying to give kudos to older people falling in love and admitting your age and not constantly chasing people over half your age, but it's very heavy handed and uninteresting. Forgettable. Paint by numbers. What more can I say. Although, in the movie's defense, I was into it until about halfway through the film. Not thinking that it was a brilliant film, but some of the comedic sequences were funny. Until it fell on its face. Then the film fell to bits.. and yes, seemed to never end.ever.but then it did. Phew.I hope Nicholson does a great film again... someday. I can only hope",happiness

"If love now reigned as it hath been And were rewarded as it hath sin, Noble men then would sure ensearch All ways whereby they might it reach, But envy reigneth with such disdain And causeth lovers outwardly to refrain, Which puts them to more and more Inwardly most grievous and sore.

"This film is brought to you by the guy who wrote and directed 1998's The Faculty. It should be just as good, right? ( Snickers) Look, you don't come in here expecting Shakespeare with a title like that, so just keep that in mind while you watch, and you should tag along just fine. This 1986 sexy comedy is about two college graduates who inherit a not so successful bikini shop from their aunt, who doesn't quite know how to turn around the sales, but will these boys be able to save her business? The REAL question is, is anyone going to sabotage their turn around? The answer, quite frankly, is YES, as they battle mishaps galore, in humorous but silly ways. As attention grows towards The Malibu Bikini Shop, so does the attention of the not so friendly customers, who aren't customers at all! Let's get this straight: The longer you watch this, the dumber it gets, and it actually insults the viewer to believe the amount of BS thrown at them. For example, ****SPOILER***** all of their stuff gets stolen from them later in the film, so they can't sell any more bikinis, however, the writer of this mess ( I already told you the name!) expects you to believe that they pretty much knit their own bikinis, at breakneck speed. Will they sell? Will you care? This is just a fun title from the 80's, it's nothing special, the laughs are almost nil, but it's not exactly a waste of time, either. It kept my attention. I give it 5 out of 10 stars",happiness

"Next of KinThere's a lot of potential wasted here in this story of a redneck (Liam Neeson) whose big city brother (Bill Paxton in a brief cameo) is killed by crime lords (including a very young Ben Stiller). Taking revenge into his own hands, the redneck makes the trek to the big city and there finds his other brother, a cop (Patrick Swayze), doing virtually nothing about the case. Swayze tries to stop his brother from comitting murder--vengeance is up to the law--but he won't hear any of it.This could have been an amazing sort of culture clash revenge movie fueled by some great performances (we've got a top-notch cast here!), but it's wasted because the film is (a) too long, (b) too stupid, and (c) far too inept to notice that the potential for great film is somewhere deep down below.What a disappointment.Rated R for violence and language.**",happiness

"Suicide Squad was a disappointment to me. May be I got hooked on the hype or was expecting too much from WB. This movie had a great concept that we saw on the small screen, both TV series and animated. For some reason, those formats did it better than this theatrical release. This movie suffered from all fronts, poor writing which is the number one problem for me. The story was just all over the place with such in coherency, it's visible at every point. Not enough time was spent in developing these characters for their introduction to the big stage. Poor dialogue was another major problem which is just so stupid at some points. But Suicide Squad still could have been saved with the main plot and a great villain. Sadly that too was a major problem. The main plot didn't make sense because the movie itself went in so many directions that none of it could have come together and gel.The villain was a total failure. Nothing about this person was intriguing and just falls so flat. Story and main purpose was so awful for a big summer blockbuster. This movie probably only had about two things going for it. Majority of the casting was great including Will Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Jared Leto, and Jai Courtney. Yes Jai Courtney, I'm shocked too. I really think his role should have been expanded. Notable miscast would be Joel Kinnaman and Cara Delevingne. Joel Kinnaman portrayal of Rick Flag was out of touch of what that character should be and for Enchantress, someone, more older with more acting depth should have been chosen over Cara Delevingne. The other thing would be, through and through it's a much better movie than Batman V Superman. I know that's not really helping but still. A weak six stars and a onetime watch.",happiness

"Tangled is the retelling of the fairy tale Rapunzel and has the typical Disney treatment. All the characters even look stock Disney except for one major difference, this movie is in 3D. And, boy what a difference that makes. Each character exhibits the entire spectrum of faces and emotions, the visuals are amazing and the use of lighting makes for some really astounding visuals.Who really steals the show is the horse Maximus. He doesn't say a word but he's funny, sympathetic, brave, noble and heroic all with just physical expressions. The other characters are equally well done. I really think this movie marks a significant achievement in Disney's animation and makes me excited about Disney movies in a long time. I highly recommend this movie to see the Disney magic done right.",happiness

"I'd imagine that it's not easy to make a poignant zombie movie. Only a handful of filmmakers have pulled it off, and even then the poignancy was sometimes hidden behind or inextricable from the gore, humor, nudity, or surrealism. With Zombie Honeymoon, writer/director Dave Gebroe succeeded in crafting a film that is accessible as well as meaningful, blackly humorous, deliciously gory, and honestly emotional.Zombie Honeymoon's exploration of love and loss is alternately heartrending, gut wrenching, gut munching, and gut splitting. The story follows newlyweds Denise and Danny (cathartically based on Gebroe's real-life sister and late brother-in-law) as their honeymoon is interrupted by an attack by a zombie. In the tradition of Romero and some other classics, the zombie's existence and targeting of Danny are never really explained; in this case, it drives home just how arbitrary personal tragedies can seem. People die randomly all the time, but no one ever expects it to happen to someone they love.Danny does die, but mysteriously revives shortly afterward. Things aren't quite back to normal, however, especially once Danny begins to manifest an insatiable hunger for human flesh. With the new cravings and the physical deterioration that we've come to associate with zombies, Danny's ghoulish transformation carries with it evident parallels to issues of addiction and disease. And suddenly there is a host of new logistical problems that Danny and Denise must face as a new married couple trying to stay together, plan for the future, and keep Danny from killing and eating too many people.This isn't the first Zombeo-and-Juliet movie, but it may be the best yet. Gebroe handles the concept adeptly, maintaining a subtle level of dark humor without allowing the film to lapse into sheer silliness (which would have been very easy for it to do, given the almost satirical premise). Zombie Honeymoon is more Zombie-Romantic-Tragedy than Zom-Rom-Com, but still delivers its share of laughs and even uplifting moments.A quick word about the leads: Graham Sibley and Tracy Coogan bring great realism to their roles as the newlyweds. They are convincing in making the transition from enthusiastic, lovestruck naiveté to shock, frustration, desperation, fear, sadness... and hunger. As their relationship becomes strained, the way they push each other away even as they cling to each other really rings true, even in the midst of some seriously blood-drenched moments.Overall, a fine film.",happiness

"Fool's Gold's biggest problem comes in the form of confusion. While employing two game lead actors, one notorious for making bad films sellable (that's you Matt!), neither Ms. Hudson or Mr. McConaughey could save this film that can't seem to decide whether it's a comedy or an action film.When an estranged couple meet mere hours after their divorce on board a privately owned super-yacht (she's working, he's slumming), their romance is instantly rekindled by a new clue into the treasure that has been their goal for years. Once they recruit the stupid and rich boat-owners, nothing's left but to be inspired by random things to each new unbelievable clue along the way.Kate Hudson positively glows on-screen here, but that radiance doesn't resonate with the rest of the film. Fool's Gold delivers very few laughs, relying mostly on slapstick and a dumb-girl character. And the whole plot doesn't even work that well. Many subplots that are put in place are never completed, and the dialogue doesn't go over well. All in all, this wasn't even a good romantic comedy OR an action movie- largely because it wouldn't commit to either genre mixing both elements unsuccessfully. Skip this one... 4/10 stars.Jay Addison",happiness

Kareena Kapoor was okay. Villains were funny than scaring. Rest provide average support except Rajat Rawail who was horrible.Story, Direction all were pedestrian. Music was highlight of movie.Especially Teri Meri And I love You song.Salman is having great run but such movie will hamper his golden run as audiences today are unforgiving if u gave them bad products.

Let's be honest: a movie doesn't always have to be intelligent, as long as it is entertaining. But this one isn't entertaining nor intelligent. It was only annoying. Not only annoying because of the acting, but also because of the bad special effects, the weak story (scientists working for the army try to influence weather so they can hit other nations with it)...I really can't find a reason why I should ever see this one again or why I should ever recommend it to anybody.

"The first part of this movie, showing Eddie Murphy's life as an African prince, is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. I loved it. The wedding ceremony alone was so funny, I almost fell out of my chair from laughing so hard. I thought this could be one of the funniest movies of all time. At about the halfway point, though, it stops being a laugh-a-minute riot, and kind of settles down into more of a quiet romance movie. The scene at the basketball game (with the man who worships Murphy) is the last really hilarious thing that happens. After that, it never again reaches the energy of the beginning. This is not really a bad thing, though: it is still enjoyable from start to finish, even during the quiet parts. It has good actors, and it is fun to watch, and that makes it a great movie. I highly recommend it; it is one of my favorite comedies. I give it 8 out of 10 stars. See it if you haven't.",happiness

"I just watched this movie and I must say it was terrible. I've been reading about Renoir and I was wholly disappointed. I was expecting something revolutionary, something really unique, but instead I found it to be cliché and boring. I suppose one could argue that that was ""the whole point of the movie"" that the upper class life was trite and boring, and that's all well and good, say what you must, but a good filmmaker need not make the movie trite and boring to prove those same qualities as a point about society. The direction was blasé, although i did enjoy the sets and the use of space. The writing was mostly predictable, and when it wasn't, it was instead, idiotic. The characters were ridiculous and not just because they were supposed to be. They were ridiculous in the way Days of Our Lives characters are ridiculous. Which leads me to my overall point of the movie: This disappointing film seems to be a precursor for today's mind-rotting, brain-boiling television soap operas. Stick this two hour movie on the WB, I'm sure couch potatoes would love to follow it as a six-week mini series, right after Smallville or One Tree Hill, maybe? Maybe Fox would like to pick it up, stick it before Lost. Although the movie's historical context and history helps the film to be a bit more impressive and allows a viewer to appreciate it in some respect, it does not save the film. Only watch this movie if it's free and you've got absolutely nothing else to do for two hours, or if you have to write a term paper on it and it's 75% of your grade. if it's any lower than 75%, try and find a cliff notes version.",happiness

"Phenomenon is a story about energy that is in everything and everyone. It's a very subtle and philosophical film that expresses more than meets your senses. It goes right for your heart and stays there. One might argue that it is a very ""sugarsweet"" tale of the things that make life (worthwhile), but there is so much more to it. The heart of the matter is that nothing goes to waste in the universe. Everything is on it's way to somewhere all the time. Energy will manifest itself without getting tired. Things, bodies, thoughts, even love, are all vessels that are secondary to the spirit that drives them. This sounds all very vague and maybe even religious-like. But indeed some things are hard to explain. Questions are often a waste of time. So don't ask where all this energy originates from. Phenomenon will not provide the answer, at least it is not pretentious in that direction because the makers realize that the human-mind is unfit to grasp this in the first place. Phenomenology is the philosophical school that investigates how things appear in the world. The film shows that it is often slightly or profoundly different from how it looks at first hand. I enjoyed the simple way of presenting this very complicated message that matters to all of us and everything else too.",happiness

"Meek librarian (Judge Reinhold) assumes the identity of his pal (Clevant Derricks) who happens to be a police officer. The charade leads to some very mild comedy. With such a fine cast, this should have been a far better film. Unfortunately the talent of Joe Mantegna, John Turturro, Meg Tilly, Harvey Keitel, Mike Starr, Fred Gwynne, and Anthony Zerbe is badly wasted. Reinhold sandwiched between Mantegna and Tilly in the front seat of a speeding police car, while they calmly discuss their failed relationship, is the best scene. Fred Gwynne in a small part as the mayor is great, but that's about it. How could such an interesting cast wind up in such a dull comedy? - MERK",happiness

"Fat Albert is well enough intentioned... I do not think that the film makers set out to destroy one of the Saturday Morning Gods in such an atrocious manner. While this genre, like the more successful comic book genre, can be done somewhat successfully (i.e. Scooby Doo), there is a fine line to walk without making the characters look empty and embarrassing. Fat Albert unfortunately does this. It takes the two dimensionality of the original characters and focuses on it until they loose whatever vibrancy they had previously. The story is contrived and supremely predictable. Grandberry is his usual chewing-on-the-scenery self. Thompson is passable as Fat Albert, but should stay far far far away from rap music for the remainder of his days. The only really enjoyable scenes in the movie were the ones with Bill Cosby. All in all, this movie is a total floater. Don't look at it, just flush.",happiness

"The nightclub’s neon light glows red with anxietyas I wait on the turning lane. Cars blur past,their headlights white as charcoal.I trust each driver not to swerve. I trust each strangernot to kill me and let me crossthe shadow of his smoky path.Trust is all I have for patrons at the bar:one man offers me a line, one man buys the kamikaze,another drinks it. Yet another wraps his armaround my waist.

His bed unfamiliar,only temporarily. Pillows without loyaltyabsorb the weight of any man, betraythe scent of the men who came before.I trust a stranger’s tongue to tell menothing valuable. It makes no promisesof truth or lies, it doesn’t swear commitments.The stranger’s hands take their time exploring.Undisguised, they do not turn to claws or pretendartistic skill to draw configurations on my flesh. Theyare only human hands with fingertipsunsentimental with discoveries, without nostalgiafor what they leave behind. I trust this strangernot to stay inside me once he enters me.I trust him to release me from the blameof pleasure.

"1 But I was thinking today about our conversation earlier in the summer. Exhausted, you lay your head on the kitchen table and said: “But what’s the difference between a monster and a cyborg? I need something to eat. Do you have any chocolate?” Opening the fridge, I said quietly and perhaps too seriously, trying to impress you: “The monster is that being who refuses to adapt to her circumstances.” Her fate. Her body. Great Britain. You said: “So, is Laloo English or British?” I said: “She’s from London.” But the more I said London, the more it sounded like a joke. LondonLondonLondon.   2 I was thinking today about what happens when you keep going in a car. This is something you can only do here. Wish for something. Did you ever do it? Wish you weren’t there? I want that go on, go even though it is unclear to me what happens when you get to the Panama Canal or Idaho. Hitchhiking in Idaho as a veritable child, I was taken in by a farming couple, Fatty and Daddy, a hundred miles or so outside of Boise. Fatty was rail thin, about seventy-five, and Daddy was a big man who had a reclining chair in each room and looked younger than his wife. They picked me up in their truck—I was sitting by the side of the road brushing the knots out of my hair with my fingers—and I stayed with them for five days. They said it was not the right thing for me to be in the open like that, and they took me to eat every day at a restaurant called Country Buffet. In my innocence, I had been walking on a road that led to the country compound of a KKK leader/operative, Charles Reynold. What is an operative? It is someone who is always planning a way in, like the hen-house fox with his beautifully red, bushy tail. Daddy, Fatty, and I hunkered down until Daddy’s nephew, Robert, stopped by on his way through nowhere and gave me a ride to Boise proper, where there was a bus station. I waited until Robert had gone and then I walked out to the main drag to get a cup of coffee and interview murderers. “I can take you as far as the state line.” “That would be lovely.” Obsessed, far from home with its gooseberry patches and grim professions based upon openings at Heathrow Airport or Nestle, the main employers in the dingy part of northwest London that constituted my origins, I said yes. Soft yes to the color green, which is going.   3 That is a tree (going) but also an ocean: a way of being saturated with color that only happens here in your country for me; for you it might happen in another place. Mine. Like Laloo, I lived for many years on an island with congested traffic flows. Thus, a juniper tree flying by the window, intensely blue, or the Atlantic Ocean, to the left, if the car has a destination to the south, such as to The Keys, is magical to me. Improbable in light of my origins. Hers. The girl in the car. I don’t know. I am writing to you, in your special writing dress made from scraps of lace as if it (the dress, the morning of writing ahead of you) is a café; as if, writing, you are hypnotizing not only the biologies of strangers and friends but also yourself. For this reason, when I think of you reading, I think of you as writing blindly. You read but you are also writing. As if my own eyes were closed, I see your white books floating in the sky above my painting of the red girl. These books are separate from my own work, here in the salt-water notebook, but they communicate with it in a nonlocal sense. Like birds.   4 This is pre but the notebook is after. Soaked already at the edge and foamy. Past future. Writing on the warp when dry. Pages. Entries by hand. That is the morning I woke up and walked to the Pacific Ocean, after a night in a motel in Florence, Oregon, complete with a dodgy door and the reality of pillows. The woman at the front desk was wearing a very pretty apron with purple and yellow flowers on it. An expatriate, she said exaggeratedly, oblivious to our common origin: “About four miles. You’re not going to walk, are you? Do you have an umbrella? You can’t go out like that, ducky.”   5 I walked towards the sound of something roaring in a day, the kind of day that is like darkness but lit up, on its forested, proximal verge by gorse, which is a bright yellow flower. Citron-yellow and a kind of tin or silver roofing with holes in it. The day. Like walking in a dreamed landscape drenched with the wrong rain. Monsoon. What kind of rain is this? I recognized the immensity but not the temperature. This was monstrous: the inability to assimilate, on the level of the senses, an ordinary experience of weather. Here is the tongue, for example, constantly darting out to feel the air: what is it? Is it summer? Is it a different season? It’s a different day. That’s okay. Damaged from her travels, in some sense unsettled, enormously anxious, a girl does it anway: gets up and goes. It’s as if the day has a memory of her and not the other way around.",happiness

"I can’t get my head around it. How did we devise a concept like just war: the slain of the Lordare dung upon the ground. I know there are distinctionsit is important to make and I don’t expect perfectionbut the chicanery of subtle thought . . . if I pick it all apartwill anything be left to sew back into sense? Cleverer minds are reconciled. Cultured, poised,the government official (Should I give him spectacles?Should they reflect the light?) pauses and replies:The President regrets . . . but consider the alternative … would you offer succour… and I can almost understand. I sleep with reason as my lover, wake beside a monsterin my bed. I fumble beneath the mask, shape my lipsto the prospect of a kill, feel your thighagainst my rump, your fingers at my throat. Oh, Rakosi, I’m still strumming on my lyre. Is there reallyso much wrong with that? I’m embarrassed by the flimsiness of my resolve, the silliness of saints and monsters,conversations with a being who can’t plausibly exist,this mockery of flagellation: this is my defective heart,this my amputated foot, this the bandage from around my head.A monster dies in the middle of his trial, anotherdenies the power of the court, two more evade arrest:in politic’s parlour game, each day annuls the last. 9/11, I say, and Afghanistan, Bali and Iraq,but I can’t fix a year to each event, what is,what well might be, are steam against a bathroom mirror:I see bits, an eye but not its double, the other ear, a chin that lacks a jawbone for support.",happiness

"Just saw the sneak preview in Tampa.  Excellent.  8 out of 10!  ... It's up there with Reese Witherspoon's Legally Blond and Tom Hanks' BIG.  It's a nostalgic romp that'll make anyone with a memory smile.Jennifer Garner sparkles with charisma and sizzles with charm.   She's got that whole `girl next door' thing going on, supercharged with a personality that just doesn't quit.  There's great chemistry amongst the cast - and all of them makes this light-hearted tale work.The plot - seemingly done to death with `Big', Peggy Sue Gets Married, 18 Again (etc) - turns out to be amazingly fresh.  It's funny, light . even logical (as a fairy tale that is) with a simple message for us all.  ""Be nice.  Do the right thing.  And live to be happy.""It'll pull the audiences (aged 8 to 80), make a ton of money for the producers and keep Garner's, Ruffalo's and Winick's phone ringing for some time to come.Curmudgeons and violence addicts will do well to sit this one out.

"I like to feel like a Champion. Listening to Frankie Valli say ""I can'ttake my eyes off of you"" I feel like New York City is a scale model in mypenthouse in North Carolina where I study economics, capital markets,and the World Bank. I like to look into a scene from the top of a building inmy hometown down at the traders who are moving here from New YorkCity because New York City started to be kind of like a losing place forwealth creation. Now I look down on them and say to myself ""I'm too bigto fail."" I take my keys off of the ledge and walk down the condominiumtower overlooking the entire city. When I reach the parking deck I openthe door of a 1980 Mercedes Benz 450 SL and coast to a place called HighStreet. I'm at High Street knocking back a gin and tonic with three girlsI met at the Arts & Technology Center conference on the decline of thebook. We have a laugh about the old guard who make a book bound inglue and then pinch angel dust off our palms. At this point I'm so high I'mlike, look, why don't we excuse ourselves and go up to my condominiumtower I've just invested 3.5 million dollars in. They are like uh, we can dothat. So we pile into my 450 SL and ride to the tower listening to the musicof Frankie Valli transform our night into a piece of artwork. Nearly there,I look around at the Arts & Technology girls and sort of hum to myself.I feel like I've hit a milestone in my evening when we trip into the foyerof my massive penthouse that has those gleaming glass cubes set into thewall you see in Miami or Miami Beach. From the cubes a glimmer of theprosperity circling this region pierces the dark in the form of an orange-yellow beam of fluorescent light. One of the girls is removing her jewelryand I'm like no, don't. She takes off her clothes instead and lies face downon the carpet. At the stereo I play a song by Frankie Valli. The other twoare kind of standing around surprised, I think, by the curtain of paperbackbooks lining the north wall. Those are only bound books I tell themwhile I finger the Kindle on my coffee table. It is the new large Kindleand we are looking at a book called Boredom by Alberto Moravia, takingturns reading passages from the screen. When we get to the part whenthe boho girl is fucking the protagonist the totally white breast of one ofthe Arts & Technology girls slips coolly from her blouse. Pretending notto notice I continue to read in my turn. The girl sitting on the other sideof me is wearing some totally white string of pearls and she's removingeverything but the pearls. I continue to read the screen while the Arts& Technology girls start to make out like I had been planning for themto do ever since we licked angel dust off each other's palms. I get up andgo to the stereo, set the needle back to the gold record ""Can't Take MyEyes Off You,"" and walk calmly to the sofa. Once I'm there I melt into thesand-rubbed upholstery with the Arts & Technology girls who haven'tyet passed out on the floor. While I'm lying with my back to the armrestI glimpse a piece of sky I've seen only in films of the old grain. It's a wildpurple darkness with a bright white hole in it. I'm thinking to myselfGod, my personal Jesus Christ and saviour, I want you to come downhere through that hole in the night and join me in Eden.",happiness

"My low expectations of this film were met admirably.  I cannot tell if it is just me, but they do not seem to be making any comedies lately that are even remotely amusing.  Time was that you go catch a comedy and be entertained. Stripes, Caddy Shack, Animal House, Blues Brothers, Airplane, Groundhog Day where have you gone (the way of Joe DiMaggio I fear).  Clearly the makers of this latest piece of dribble are unfamiliar with the past and are, quite unfortunately, living in the present.  This latest ""masterwork"" is just plain bad.  A typical Saturday Night Live Alum offering.  Spade offers 90 minutes of his not-so clever quips and mixes in some unrealistic romance with a woman who would not give Spade the time of day.  Everything was telegraphed. There were no surprises.  What we get is boy meets girl, boy does something stupid to woo girl (stealing her dog), boy competes with some arrogant stud for girl, and boy gets girl in the end.  Add some stupid animal high-jinx and there you have it, a flat D minus.",happiness
"I know a lot of people hate this movie and it's rated ridiculously low but it has always been a favourite of mine.Bright colours and goofy pre-historic puns make it easy for the whole family to watch, and if you have to get up to do something, you won't miss any crucial plot points.There may be some casting that you didn't like but Jane Krakowski is perfect as Betty and Alan Cumming is always perfect, he plays great as Great Gazoo AND Mick Jagged (""snag m. Even Joan Collins was outrageous as mother Slaghoople, but who else could bring glam to a time without modern techniques?? And, as reminder, she was a prequel version of Liz Taylor from the original. Special mention to Thomas Gibson as the handsome villain. I'm no movie producer or whatever but the sets looked mostly real, unlike most movies now filmed almost exclusively in warehouses, and the effects they do use are better than some I see now, 17 years later. Sure, if you look closely, the lighting is off or poor depth perspective on some of the fast-moving effects, but this was the show based on a cartoon style that repeated it's backgrounds while eyes and mouths basically had two positions, open and closed. The music is rompy and fun, classic style meet-cute and Vegas tunes. And who doesn't love an origin story? And I can't resist a Vegas movie. Hello? Ann Margrock seeing a stone-age Elvis cover? EPIC! Flintstones (this one and it's predecessor) are among the first of the live-action cartoon revivals, I cash cow that Disney is now suckling to. I haven't noticed any of the older reviews on here point out specific issues, so I would argue they weren't open to liking the movie in the first place.",happiness

"Big Game is mainly about the US President, played by Samuel L. Jackson, rescued by a young boy who is on a hunting mission, which lead the two into an unlikely bond and soon face a band of terrorists. That strange yet magnificent idea easily sums up what you're going to get in this movie. In concept, this is supposed to be Finland's take on the old school Hollywood action movies. It sets in a life of local deer hunters around a preposterous action movie plot and the movie just embraces the silliness, and without any pretension, this results to one of the most delightful experiences one would get in a dumb action movie in a while. And even for a B-movie (if that's what they claim), there is so much impressive achievements to look around, which sometimes the film felt a little too smug about it. But this film offers more excitement than what this rather simple plot suggests.And just like what the classics do, it begins with tons of exposition, to fully establish the characters and the plot. But instead of being about some regular guy who gets mixed up with a tough situation, we get a kid who already seem competent to the job, but haven't fully earned his skill and experience, yet. It takes long enough to get to the real action, but the real shining moments here are whenever the two misfits interact, trying to bear with each other and contradict with the ridiculous choices one of them makes for survival, in a naturally comedic sense. While the threat still involves some risks and violence, this journey is all lighthearted. The heroes are basically just running around, choosing some crazy ways to escape from the bad guys as adventurous as possible. There's another side to this which takes place in Pentagon where the government officials are searching for the President. These scenes don't offer beyond than serving exposition and reveal needless twists, but isn't as exciting as the actual adventure.People may still clamor this as a B-movie, but even for that impression, every visual and scale actually look more impressive than most Hollywood blockbusters today tend to offer. It looks heavily CGI-ed and people usually point out the flaws of the aesthetics, but here it's just beautifully bright and shiny that it never really matter if it's real or not. It simply polishes the supposedly dumb as schlock action, which might have lead the direction to somewhat slow the pace for style and swagger that sometimes becomes dragging, but the images brought a huge benefit, anyway. The performances are just delightful. No one might have done it better as this President than Samuel L. Jackson. It may sound like a punchline at first, but then he eventually manages to give something engaging to this character, and of course, Jackson does what he does best. But the actor who really steals the show here is Onni Tommila, who happens to be the the real action hero among the duo. Aside of excitingly pulling off warrior-like instincts, he also manages to get invested to the character's arc and comedic moments. The ones who play the villains stay campy as they should, and there is a surprising amount of other great actors here who aren't nearly as memorable as its stars, but they did their job solidly, anyway.Big Game is a lot of fun, with a variety of amusingly odd ideas that come off great for a mindless action experience. But the best parts are really when the two heroes are together, trying to fit in from their unlikeness. I guess the only major thing to complain now is there should be more. It's not like that is going to make this a masterpiece, but it does left you wanting more, like we want to see more of these characters and explore more absurdity that this journey can come with. I mean, there's a scene where a fridge, where our heroes are hiding, is rolling down into the waterfall, with Samuel L. Jackson's character paranoia adding up the pricelessness of the scene. And that's just one example of what makes this movie delightfully adventurous.",happiness

"Kevin James plays Griffin Keyes, an average guy in an average job. He has a kind heart and an above average ability to relate to the animals in his care as the zookeeper of The Franklin Park Zoo in Boston.The film opens with Griffin breaking up with his long time girlfriend Stephanie (Leslie Bibb). He weathers the disappointment and we fast forward 5 years where Griffin has now become the head zookeeper. At a celebration of his brother's upcoming wedding, Griffin spots Stephanie and his old feelings for her bubble to the surface. Lost and confused Griffin's animal buddies come to his rescue by 1 - letting him in on the secret that animals can communicate with humans (in English no less) and 2 - teaching him how to win the female of his species (advice that may be better left as that - advice) Some physical humor and not so funny scenes and lines fill out the movie for the long 104 minutes. Rosario Dawson plays Kate, the obvious new love interest for Griffin.Unless you're between the ages of 8 and 12 leave this one unseen - I don't even think it is worth the matinée price. Maybe catch it some time when it has been ""formatted to fit this screen"" and ""shortened to fit in the time allotted"".",happiness

"I have to say I loved this film. I went to see it with a Japanese friend, and she loved it too.So the plot wasn't full of 'save the world' ambitions and the good guy wasn't a millionaire playboy, but who cares? It was a gorgeous straightforward film about two people meeting at a certain time in their lives.I read a quote recently about someone who'd seen the movie and came out wanting to hug everyone they met - and I totally agree. I cycled home humming the tunes and feeling like I haven't felt from a film since seeing 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. I know, I know - totally different films - but the zen-like feeling after seeing them both...From a Dublin dweller, it was fun to watch the geography, as the film makers played with the locations in that certain venues were on the same street - yet it looked like the actors had to walk through town to get to them. It definitely hindered the 'who do I know in the public street' shots moments! But was interesting, as helped make Dublin be a different city to what the residents would be used to.My recommendation is to just go and see it if you're on for seeing something uncomplicated, feel-good without being too mushy, comedic moments that everyone can relate to and some singer-songwriter music thrown in.",happiness

"Closed in and Claustrophobic: I felt I could breathe only when the scenes escaped outside of the theater stage and onto the snow covered train depot or the green fields where Levin was sowing grass, or where love was a lazy-day picnic on the greenest of grasses, but only briefly and only disappointingly, after again finding myself cramped and stifled in a hot sweltering and old 19th century theater. The ball room scene was excruciating. The dances and dancers themselves reminded me of a mix of street dance, country and western, and some invented Tim Burtonesque ""Danse Macabre"" for the purposes of being unique, strange, and possibly ""histrionic"". The moves were stiff and unflattering and I was embarrassed to watch Anna and Vronsky clumsily make there way through the physical distortions that made their clothes appear ill-fitting and as though they both had two left feet. I could not feel the same passionate love between Anna and Vronsky in this movie adaptation as I'd previously felt in reading the novel. The emphasis on cinematic style and surrealism kept interrupting my wish to re-live and enjoy the story. Further, contradictory to the memories of my mind's eye of the handsome and manly Vronsky in the novel, I came to see him in the movie as bit effeminate-looking, weak, and depicted as a vulnerable little mommy's boy. I paid my ticket expectant and hopeful but at the end and as I exited the theater I found myself confused, disappointed, and ripped-off. Anna Karenina will always be one of the greatest experiences in literature I've had the pleasure of. But next time, as surely there will be yet a ""next time"", I'll simply pass on the movie. I simply cannot bear the risk of seeing Vronsky look like that again.",happiness

There is not one minute where you will not be rolling in laughter and Kutcher and Mac are excellent in their roles. Better than the original, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. Kutcher plays Theresa's boyfriend, who happens to be white. Bernie Mac plays the father who is apprehensive about his daughter dating a white man. Hilarity ensues for the next 2 hours.

"I had the misfortune of catching 'Grounded' the other day and found it to be a rather pointless little film not worth the ninety minutes or so it takes to view it, and I'm usually lenient on Christmas films. The film revolves around five kids of divorced parents, aged between twelve and fifteen, who are travelling alone before Christmas to visit their other parent. When the airport in snowed in, they go on a rampage with predictable 'Home Alone'-style tricks and out-smarting of airport staff.I can't complain too much about the acting of the kids. It's nothing special but neither are they terrible, although it is only Tyler James Williams (better known as Chris, from the TV show 'Everybody Hates Chris') who stands out for his expressive ways and wide-eyed sweetness. The adult cast are forgettable since they barely make much of an appearance other than the brief scenes where they come across as inept losers in face of the kids' antics.'Grounded' fails, largely, because the five kids are far too old to be carrying on like the eight-year-olds they are depicted as nor is there much of a point to their unruly behaviour. They were locked up because they acted like brats and don't deserve to be portrayed as heroes we should all hail. At least, in 'Home Alone', Kevin was not only just eight but he was justified in his tricks because he was defending his home. The toilet humour and the dumbed down show of kids outsmarting big, stupid adults only added to why this film is aimed at undiscerning youngsters under the age of ten. What didn't help elevate the film was the way it portrayed divorced kids as being 'special' and somehow less well-off than children of married parents when there are many well-adjusted kids of divorced parents out there who would be offended by this idea.This film is pointless for anyone who's seen 'Home Alone', a superior Christmassy film about a kid trumping the adults. I can't see many folk past primary school-age who will find much interest in it.",happiness

"Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullmann) is an actress who became mute in a play. Her doctor (Margaretha Krook) says that Elisabeth is mute by option, in a kind of sophisticated suicide, and decides to send Elisabeth to her house on the beach with the company of the nurse Alma (Bibi Andersson). While together, Alma initially worships the actress, opening her heart and secrets to her. Later, she feels betrayed, after reading a letter of Elisabeth and then she changes her personality to act like Elisabeth. This movie is open to the most different interpretations and it probably is a marvelous essay for those professionals and students of psychological area. As a lover of cinema, I really appreciated the usual outstanding direction of Ingmar Bergman and the stunning performances of Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann. This theatrical film keeps the camera basically all the time focusing the two lead actresses, and Liv Ullmann, even performing a mute character, offers to the viewers magnificent expressions. Unfortunately, the quality of the VHS released in Brazil by the Brazilian distributor Continental is a shame, having subtitles in Portuguese on (covering) the English subtitles. Further, this is the unique option we have in my country to watch this film, since it has not been released on DVD or in restored copy. The title in Brazil is simply ridiculous! My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): 'Persona  Quando Duas Mulheres Pecam' ('Persona  When Two Women Sin')",happiness
"The previews did not prepare me for this movie what so ever. I expected a cute animated cartoon about some dancing penguins instead I got some deep philosophical story line. Don't get me wrong, the movie was well made, there were some terrific scenes that you can tell that the designers put their heart and soul into, but the plot was a little out of whack. A kid watching this movie, would probably fall asleep; it started off really cute and funny-ish but then the writers went off on a completely irrelevant curb that made the movie super long and super pointless for any kid under 10. An adult may have found this movie insightful and thought provoking, but also a little confusing and overwhelming. It's a good movie but there were too many messages and meanings that were left undone and left me wanting more for a person that just wanted to see a cute animated cartoon about some dancing penguins.",happiness

Obviously it is especially amusing for those of us who lived through the pop excesses of the 80s, but I have to say the teens in the audience seemed to enjoy it too.All the songs are pure cheese (and incredibly infectious), which coupled with some amusing lines, a very lovable Hugh Grant, a very cute Drew Barrymore, and fabulous supporting roles from Kristen Johnston and Aasif Mandvi make this movie a great romantic comedy for those of us who actually enjoy a ""bit of fluff"".",happiness

"""Best of Youth (La Meglio gioventù)"" proves that Italians have learned the art of the long-form television mini-series that the British have long mastered.Covering a somewhat same period of the baby boom generation as ""In A Land of Plenty,"" it has more of the generational feel of individuals caught up in history as we have usually seen in British mini-series about end-of-the-eras or World War I, such as ""Brideshead Revisited"" and ""Jewel in the Crown."" U.S. mini-series were more successful as sweeping historical epics, even when they were also family sagas like ""Roots"" and ""Centennial;"" when the networks tried to interpret more recent history, as in ""The Sixties,"" the set characters sped through ""Zelig"" and ""Forest Gump""-like in happening to be at the right place at the right time; perhaps the several seasons combined of the NBC series ""American Dreams"" could be considered comparable in showing how the times that are a-changing affect a family.""Best of Youth"" is being released in the U.S. in movie theaters, though I'm not sure even shown in two parts of three hours each how edited it is from the original format, as other grand European mini-series like ""Berlin Alexanderplatz,"" ""Das Boot"" and ""Fanny and Alexander"" were originally only shown in the U.S. in truncated theatrical versions as even PBS seems averse to television with subtitles so we rarely get to see the best of world television. Comparison to the Italian film ""The Leopard"" is unfair as that was not created in the same format and covers a shorter period of historical time.""Best of Youth"" combines charismatic acting, leisurely directing amidst beautiful scenery in several parts of Italy with writing that takes the trajectories of complex yet consistent characters' lives believably and searingly affected by uniquely Italian experiences of the baby boomers' young adult years through middle age, without the American tendency to reject or regret youthful ambitions, through the lens of local natural disasters, violent political activities, judicial battles against the Cosa Nostra, European economic changes, with regional variations, that Americans rarely see in movies. The focus is primarily on two brothers from the 1960's almost to the present, played by two actors who must be the equivalent of George Clooney and Richard Chamberlain in Italian television. Alessio Boni in particular as Matteo captures the screen with such tortured macho dynamism that it's no wonder he's gone on to play Heathcliff and Dracula in other mini-series. His Paul Newman-like startling blue eyes become a talking point of the series and a continuing visual leitmotif. Similarly, the physical differences between the two actors help to point up the different paths the brothers take through life, even as the casting of other family members to look like them is eerily effective. The series is particularly good at capturing the camaraderie amongst old male friends over the years and the intimate interactions of members of a family, particularly with children, with a strong theme of the importance of both as an anchor.Unlike in American TV where women are adjuncts as the girlfriend/wife/mother, the key women here are crucial fulcrums in the brothers' lives and have separate intellectual, psychological and emotional demands. The emotions are important here -- grief is shown very movingly, with more pain and tears than American culture usually allows. In one extended scene, we see a grieving mother walk slowly up a long flight of stairs in numbed silence and gradually see her revive as she learns of surprise news about her son. There are of course some coincidences of family members' and friends' paths crossing at key junctures, but the story overall grips us. The pop music selections,American, European and Italian, are wonderfully evocative.",happiness

"Kambakkht Ishq is a very cheap comedy. Akshay Kumar once again fails to prove and bring new in himself. For me, this movie is nothing. Just bores you. Total waste of time and money. Very cheap comedy throughout the movie and the story says Kambakkht Ishq = SEX. I was expecting Akshay will prove himself. The only thing I found worth was Kareena Kapoor's body which director has focused very much. Anu Mallik's music is totally disappointing. Doesn't entertain you any moment. The film has no story, revolves around just one aspect sex and affairs. So, to take my word don't go for this movie. Instead sit in your home and hire some great DVDs and watch them. The film is not worth watching. Let god save Akshay...",happiness

"Get tired of seeing the same movie again and again. Naturally all the dates she gets fixed up with are losers (from the standard selection) except the obvious choice. There is a gay couple and they are very happy together. Some obnoxious family members. The nicest part of the movie is the wooden rowing craft - not a racing shell, bit more to it, but beautiful. The lonely handsome Dad. The lovely daughter that for some reason somebody dumped. The empty headed promiscuous blonde. The roommate or friend who pretends to some wisdom but is unsuccessful himself.

"Not only could I not tear myself away from this movie, I found myself watching it again the same night when it aired a second time.Any true Oldman fan should find this a very enjoyable movie and be amazed yet again at how chameleon-like this man is in his performances. It seems he can portray any character with any accent with complete believability.For anyone looking for a romance that falls out of Hollywood's tired old formula and challenges stereotypes, then this is a perfect movie for you.If you happen to have a problem watching little people live perfectly normal adult lives (family life, partying, fighting, sex,...) then I am sorry for your loss on a great movie. I particularly loved the scene where Carol visits her fiancée's family for a backyard dinner and gets the kindest responses to her awkward questions. I also loved how the character Rolfe's eyes follow her everywhere not in a greedy and lusty way but in a dreamy and tender way...as though he is amazed and in awe that someone so beautiful could learn so much and become so accepting in such a short amount of time.Well there were plenty of great scenes but I won't detail the whole movie. I know some people had a problem with the lead being ""non little"" but I found myself doing some research and discovered there are over 100 different types of dwarfism. One of them is characterized by a normal looking torso and head size so maybe this movie isn't as inaccurate as some people would think...I loved it...just my opinion.",happiness

"This Eddie Murphy comedy was somewhat funny at times, but I don't know...for me it missed the mark. Started out relatively strong, but faded in the end when it got a bit to sentimental, which admittedly a lot of comedies tend to do. The story has Murphy as a Prince who is to be married to a woman who has been groomed to be his bride by following his every command. Eddie's character does not want this though, he yearns to find real love so he is off to America a place where not everyone knows who he is to find Mrs. Right as it were. He gets a job as a worker at a McDonald's rip off type joint (which to me is the funniest parts of the movie) and falls for the daughter of the man who runs this establishment all the while keeping his identity as a prince a secret. Arsenio is rather good as his faithful traveling companion as is most of the cast. They are not the problem, the fact this movie tends to lag is. Slow lengths of the film where there is not all that much funny stuff going on, the movie is under two hours, but feels more like a two and a half hour movie. I say I would have liked it more had they trimmed it down ten or so minutes and kept the laughs going throughout the whole movie as they were the first part of it.",happiness

"I do get irritated with modern adaptations of Shakespeare when the director can't make his mind up whether to use the original or to update it. If it's using the original words in an updated setting, that's particularly tricky if set in the 20th or 21st century although it can work OK in period styles, eg the Trevor Nunn Twelfth Night set late Victorian very effectively. It could work with the 30's setting if only there had been far less of the song and dance and far more of Shakespeare's text. Unfortunately, it just ends up being a pretty trivial though very pleasant show. Another problem is Branagh himself. I agree he's far too old to play one of the students but more important, he's such an experienced Shakespearean actor that in spite of all his efforts to be just another student, his strength of acting shows all the time. Of course he should have played the King - no problem in having a mature student King surrounded by younger students. Instead we had a pleasant but unimposing actor for the King, thus an unimposing so-called King with no Kingly attributes. The amount of song and dance, which I found tedious in spite of the nice songs and pleasant enough dancing, unfortunately meant the great Shakespearean dialogue had to be cut down drastically. So the whole thing ends up a trivial and mild confection, and I got very bored, including with the comic turns, and was glad when it ended. Branagh has not done Shakespeare justice in this production.Accolades however to Richard Briers and Geraldine McEwan, absolutely splendid as the older couple.",happiness

Cast just speaks out their lines without any emotions; special thanks to Charlie Snows (Baldwin) soon-to-be-ex-wife who talks about her divorce like the rest of us talk about the weather. Just horrible (and funny).With lots of booze and friends this might just make it as a background entertainment and few laughs, just like Ed Wood-movies.

The film does'nt get boring, even if watched for the 23rd time! It's pure magic - you could endlessly listen to the conversations, the beautiful music and enjoy the excellent acting! Other films try to come in too trendy with freaky music and sexual content(not that there's anything wrong with that) - but it's not a feelgood movie! Besides the puns and the lovely warm hearted atmosphere does the rest! To everyone who hasn't yet seen this movie - rent it, buy it - enjoy it!",happiness

"My son's been learning time: big hand and little, powers of sixty and of twenty-four, the slow semaphore of days. He's brought home paper plates from kindergarten, arrows pointing at his favorite hours. So far the face of every clock has smiled. And before we read to sleep each night he crosses off another square on the calendar above his bed, counting down to Christmas or to nothing in particular, sometimes just a line he draws uphill or down, check marks like the ones his teacher leaves on sheets he's filled with capitals and lower cases, other times a pair of thick lines like the crossed bones on a pirate's flag, an X as if to mark the treasure buried in some ordinary week, no day yet a cross to bear.",happiness
"Yes this movie is more like National Treasure than Indiana Jones, but National Treasure at least had interesting characters in it. This movie did not. It wasn't so much that the premise was ridiculous and the dialog mediocre. It was more that the action was ridiculous. Totally ridiculous situations with totally ridiculous escapes plus the worse shooting from villains I've ever seen. The actors do the best they can with what they have and only William H. Macy stands out, given a somewhat interesting character. And in a brief appearance so does Delroy Lindo. The rest are very forgettable and some stupid even for example the computer geek. All in all a beyond ridiculous, poor action movie trying too hard with the worse use of music I've ever come across. Glad when it was over 4/10.",happiness

"At first i wanna confess that i've downloaded this movie from the net just to be sure if i want to buy its blu-ray and i must say that i was really surprised with this enchanted movie.If you ask me is there anything different from the other teenage movies,i would say NO.But i think at some point it is deeper from the others.Cause it doesn't try to give you big messages and it has one and a half hour only about the simple meaning of 'life' and the teenagers that you can almost see them at every corner.I still don't know why i'm so excited with this 'just' movie but i can easily say that it's one of the best movies in 2008.And oh Kat Dennings!!She's way better than herself at 'House Bunny'.I hope we can see these bunch of talented people more in the future and i'm sorry that most of the people won't be able to watch this in my country,Turkey.Definitely it's a movie that i would be happy to see in my hi-def collection.I can't wait to get this one...",happiness

"Danny Fisher(John Cena) is a man who has the great life, he is police detective for New Orleans, he has a beautiful girlfriend named Molly(Ashley Scott) who is a nurse. But an incident that happened a year ago, will soon come back to haunt Danny. Before he made detective, he was a blue suit policeman, that was in hot pursuit of a terrorist named Miles Jackson(Aidian Gillian), and his girlfriend. When he soon had them cornered, Miles girlfriend tried to make a run for it, but is killed instantly after being hit by a car. Miles wants revenge on Danny. And in a year later, Miles escapes from prison, and kidnaps Molly, and blows up there house. Danny is forced to Miles deadly games, if he ever wants Molly to make it out alive. Will Danny save Molly before it's too late? Although it is not very original, but entertaining for the most part, it does not try to be anything more then it is. It had terrific action, and I liked the enjoyable view of New Orleans. John Cena gave a pretty descent performance, I liked the way he was not played so one dimensional, like some action heroes are sometimes portrayed. Ashley Scott and Aidan Gilliam are also good. And well directed by Renny Harlin.",happiness

"The pleasure of walking a long time on the mountainwithout seeing a human being, much less speaking to one. And the pleasure of speaking when one is suddenly there.The upgrade from wary to tolerant to convivial,so unlike two brisk bodies on a busy streetfor whom a sudden magnetic attractionis a mistake, awkwardness, something to be sorry for. But to loiter, however briefly, in a clearingwhere two paths intersect in the matrix of chance.To stop here speaking the few words that come to mind.A greeting. Some earnest talk of weather.A little history of the day. To stand there then and say nothing.To slowly look around past each other.Notice the green tang pines exude in the heatand the denser sweat of human effort. To have nothing left to saybut not wanting just yet to move on.The tension between you, a gossamer thread.It trembles in the breeze, holdingthe thin light it transmits. To be held in thatline of force, however briefly,as if it were all that mattered. And then to move on.With equal energy, with equal pleasure.",happiness

"Lying asleep between the strokes of night     I saw my love lean over my sad bed,     Pale as the duskiest lily’s leaf or head, Smooth-skinned and dark, with bare throat made to bite, Too wan for blushing and too warm for white,     But perfect-coloured without white or red.     And her lips opened amorously, and said – I wist not what, saving one word – Delight. And all her face was honey to my mouth,     And all her body pasture to mine eyes;          The long lithe arms and hotter hands than fire, The quivering flanks, hair smelling of the south,     The bright light feet, the splendid supple thighs          And glittering eyelids of my soul’s desire.",happiness

"""Woo"" has a fine cast.  Jada Pinkett has great charisma.  Tommy Davidson is a fine comic actor, though he isn't too convincing as a straight-arrow law student.  The film is written in sitcom format.  The film consists of one implausible scene of conflict after another (especially at the Italian restaurant), desperate to find a punchline.  Some of the scenes work.  I thought the scene at the transvestite bar was hilarious.  And I liked the little cameo by Billy Dee.  That gave the film a touch of class.  It's too bad LL Cool J only had one scene.  I liked his smooth ""mack daddy"" character.  But with a film like this, even though it's a comedy, your disbelief elevates by the minute and it just doesn't have a natural, character-driven flow.  It forces itself upon the audience.  And the third act is predictable and unconvincing.  This is a film that could've been more than OK, if it had a little more wit and focus.  If this is about a 1 or 2 dollar rental at your local video store--this is not a bad film to rent. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this one.",happiness

"If anybody remembers this title, then they remember how bad it is. And I don't imagine its aged well. First film of TriStar Pictures, hey, they can't all be winners, and this one, believe it or no, made a little bit of money for the company, considering the budget. So what's this movie about? There's a hot bod contest, and somebody wants to win. Is that it, you ask? HEY, it's Where The Boys Are, its not called Where The Good Movies Are. If you won't have fun in the sun, then you'll just have fun. That, or you'll turn this off 20 minutes in, and find something else to watch. Far cry from the 60's original, this remake is over saturated with beach nudity. Whoever said all movies have to be made with class never watched this one, and maybe they should. 4 out of 10 from me.

Divya hates lovely and tries to get rid of him by playing the mystique lover Chhaya through phone with help of her friend Maya (Rose Dawn aka Hazel Keech) what happens next is the plot while lovely saves Divya from goons.The music is awesome, actions are a bit superficial, cinematography is the watch out factor, acting is good from everyone but the real deal Salman Khan will rock the box office with his mannerisms.

"This is the type of goofy, sexy romp Cinemax used to show on weekends in the 80's (before they switched to soft porn). It's not going to rank up there with Dr. Strangelove or Tootsie, but it's good for some silly fun. The lead actress Julia Lehman is very cute, and I hope to see more of her. If you enjoyed the teen comedies of the 80s like Weird Science, Screwballs, HOTS, and Loose Screws, this is a movie for you. It's a bit short; they could have added some more scenes away from the primary two locations and spent more time at the webcast house. I would recommend it for a weekend rental. If you like silly laughs to counter all the serious dramas flooding the market and to take the edge off the rat race, this is a good movie.",happiness
"Boy, Crown International Pictures have done it again. That is, churned out yet another entirely forgettable teen comedy, with sex and gratuitous nude scenes to draw in the crowds. TOMBOY is a pitifully-written '80s high school comedy about the titular character, a tomboy who dreams of winning over the hunk of her dreams. Will she manage it? Does anybody care? It took me a while to realise that the lead actress, Betsy Russell, is better known for playing Jigsaw's wife in the SAW franchise. She's COMPLETELY unrecognisable here which shows how much work she must have had done. Still, Russell is a pretty poor actress, failing to invest her character with any moments of sympathy, and the rest of the cast are no better. The humour is so lightweight that it's easy to miss it, and the racing scenes and stuff are all predictable and have been done better elsewhere. TOMBOY really is a film to miss.Trivia fans take note: director Herb Freed is better known for helming the early '80s slasher GRADUATION DAY, which is considerably better than this film!",happiness

"Old Man, or Lad's-love,—in the name there's nothing To one that knows not Lad's-love, or Old Man, The hoar-green feathery herb, almost a tree, Growing with rosemary and lavender. Even to one that knows it well, the names Half decorate, half perplex, the thing it is: At least, what that is clings not to the names In spite of time. And yet I like the names.   The herb itself I like not, but for certain I love it, as some day the child will love it Who plucks a feather from the door-side bush Whenever she goes in or out of the house. Often she waits there, snipping the tips and shrivelling The shreds at last on to the path, perhaps Thinking, perhaps of nothing, till she sniffs Her fingers and runs off. The bush is still But half as tall as she, though it is as old; So well she clips it. Not a word she says; And I can only wonder how much hereafter She will remember, with that bitter scent, Of garden rows, and ancient damson-trees Topping a hedge, a bent path to a door, A low thick bush beside the door, and me Forbidding her to pick.                                              As for myself, Where first I met the bitter scent is lost. I, too, often shrivel the grey shreds, Sniff them and think and sniff again and try Once more to think what it is I am remembering, Always in vain. I cannot like the scent, Yet I would rather give up others more sweet, With no meaning, than this bitter one.   I have mislaid the key. I sniff the spray And think of nothing; I see and I hear nothing; Yet seem, too, to be listening, lying in wait For what I should, yet never can, remember: No garden appears, no path, no hoar-green bush Of Lad's-love, or Old Man, no child beside, Neither father nor mother, nor any playmate; Only an avenue, dark, nameless, without end.",happiness
"I really enjoyed this cute, light-hearted romantic comedy despite some of the negative reviews I had been reading. I'd reluctantly joined a friend and really wasn't expecting much, but surprisingly found Aloha to be very entertaining, heartwarming and fun. Perhaps it didn't have the most complex plot, but both of us thought it was a great story about relationships, past hurts, and love - bringing lots of laughter and some twists and tears in the end. I found that the mix of characters worked very well together and they really grew on me as the movie progressed. The Hawaiian scenes and music brought back some fond memories of days spent on the Islands. loved the mix of cast and characters and would definitely recommend this story for a fun, light, summer flick!",happiness

"The Preservation is nothing like that, but don't be surprised if it reminds you of it.It only takes five minutes for the clumsy characterization of our protagonists to unfold and to bluntly reveal the entire movie's agenda, which is reinforced just as heavy-handedly throughout the next 85 minutes until the very end. But who cares about that, right? In fact the cast looks way better than what we see in the typical outdoor horror and the production quality seems quite adequate. That is why you would never expect to see such absurdly bad and unbelievable scenes. It begins with the first death of the movie and gets progressively worse until you wish to never sit through another movie of that writer again. Instead of following their internal logic characters are puppeteered into situations and actions, thus never feeling alive. The cast, Wrenn Schmidt in particular, does the best they can, but a storyline this bad just can't be saved.I can only assume the writer saw Eden Lake, enjoyed it thoroughly and got ideas for supposedly very cool scenes, which he wrapped up in the mess of a plot we see before us. This is one of those cases where I wonder how the movie even got produced, one thing is for certain - the preservation should have remained closed.",happiness

"In terms of production value, the film looks great. It's got better actors than most horror flicks and the FX and monsters are good. It also has a good creepy vibe to it and some good scares. The problem is, the script doesn't really go anywhere after they get to the house... Its basically a series of creepy scenes where the cast dwindles as we go along, but you don't really have a sense of escalating tension. The first half worked fairly well, but it doesn't change much as it goes along. We get some backstory as we go that wasn't that creepy to me, and its also pretty clear they didn't know how to end it. The ending they have just doesn't work at all.My biggest complaint though is the soundtrack which is way too repetitive and is basically a ripoff from the Shining soundtrack.Its okay if you want to get some decent scares, but its not going to blow you away.",happiness

"This was incredible. I'm living at the moment in the awful urban sprawl of Dublin , Ireland and took myself right into the inner city to see this and, to my surprise, found myself being transported not only to another land but also to another time. When I came out, I was in a trance for the rest of the day, pining for a land and society that is no more and dreaming sweet dreams of angelic Pocahontas, gentle John Rolfe and ruggedly genuine John Smith. All three of course excellently played by Q'uiranka (is that right), Christian and even Colin who, though the accent may have been shaky, captured perfectly what it would have been to be in John Smith's situation. Mallick, of course, is a genius and when his films are this good they're well worth the decade or so of waiting. Also, I don't know who the director of photography was but what a job they did, possibly the most beautiful film ever put on screen. All in all, a masterpiece which I'll carry with me every step I take in this ofttimes sorry world.",happiness

"It was a moment of utter spontaneity when I decided to purchase a ticket to see 'Lucy', and wow - I am certainly glad I did. This is one of the best films I have seen in a long time. At the beginning, I thought that perhaps it wasn't going to be my cup of tea. However, as it progressed the storyline became more and more fascinating. In my opinion this film had the perfect balance of realism and sci-fi. Some of the effects were of course slightly questionable... but I cannot really complain because the overall brilliance of this film outshone any negatives I could detect.Scarlett Johansson was incredible as Lucy and it was astonishing to observe how her character changed so dramatically within just a few moments. Johansson definitely nailed the smart-girl/genius/superhero role, although I do think this role may have suited an actress like Rooney Mara absolutely perfectly. Johansson is just so womanly, attractive and feminine that I found it difficult to completely accept her as Lucy. Perhaps that's just me bring too picky - I just feel that Lucy could have been better portrayed by someone slightly more masculine and cold.This film is one that will genuinely inspire you to think deeply about evolution, human nature, and life. I left the cinema feeling like I had been given a new kick of energy and a punch of enthusiasm for personal growth and exploration. This film will also encourage you to consider the endless possibilities of technology and science. It will leave your heart pound if and your brain buzzing. Overall, this is a definite must-see for all action/sci-fi lovers as well as those who have an interest in humanity, history and the incredible gift that is life. You will not at all regret purchasing a ticket to see this, and as long as you keep an open mind, you will find this film to be extremely thought-provoking and clever.",happiness

"...Topher Grace, whom I must now admit is talented enough to give even a ludicrous character like ""Pete"" some semblance of humanity, and (to my even bigger surprise) Josh Duhamel, who made the title character someone you could care about, which in and of itself is an achievement worthy of an Oscar. They, alone, are worth the hour and a half this movie takes up of your life.As for the rest...well...the main characters in West Virginia are supposedly in their early twenties, but they all talk and act like they're freshmen in high school. I can't tell if that was a deliberate choice in dialog, a problem in casting or an obscene swipe at the ""simplicity of the rural folk,"" known to those on the coasts as ""the great flyover."" The ""big date"" is tossed aside so quickly and perfunctorily, it's like a bad blind date from a bad ""reality"" TV show on a low- rent cable channel. And then there's the vomiting moment that...oh, I have to stop.Y'know, I was talked into watching this...and for the sakes of Josh and Topher, I'm glad I did.

We were in the Cinema anyway so why not. We went mostly, I suppose, as we'd seen Glen Hansard and the Frames playing before and they were great so we thought the movie couldn't be too bad. At the end of the day we both really liked this movie, not too sentimental and the music which is written and performed by the two main characters is excellent. It irks me to see other Irish people in here with such negative views, it really seems like its something personal towards Glen Hansard. I don't know the guy whatsoever but this is about the film which is worth seeing.I'd seen Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova live in Christchurch cathedral in Dublin which in itself was pretty different. I'd only been inside the cathedral once before pretty much as a tourist. During the gig he gave a solo performance which stands out in my mind as the best I've ever seen, just him and an acoustic guitar. I've seen A LOT of bands big and small so that is really saying something. If you get a chance go see them.",happiness
"I can't say my attention span allowed me to sit through this. But where did the Australian link come in, other than being decimated by fireballs.From what I could see, most of the filming was in South Africa. Which would have been convenient, as their countryside is quite similar in parts and also that they drive on the correct side of the road.Not even the license plates had been changed.What was great was that Mythbusters was on Discovery at around the same time.Shows like this and another recent wreck (Poseidon Adventure), really bring into question the integrity of some of the players: Peter Fonda, Tia Carrere, Lance Hendriksen. Or is it that they're that washed up they'll take a dollar any where they can?",happiness

"This story is mixed with romance, love, and friendship. I really enjoyed this movie. Its actually quite funny too.Aquamarine (who is played by Sara Paxton is a fantastic actor i reckon)is a mermaid who needs to find love in 3 days or she will be forced to marry some she doesn't wanna get married to. She decides she wants Raymond who is extremely popular and all the girls are after him including the two best friends who found aqua.The endings are very sweet and aquamarine is just so funny cause she doesn't know much about boys and life on the surface.Good Movie!",happiness

"Dear love, for nothing less than thee Would I have broke this happy dream;             It was a theme For reason, much too strong for fantasy, Therefore thou wak'd'st me wisely; yet My dream thou brok'st not, but continued'st it. Thou art so true that thoughts of thee suffice To make dreams truths, and fables histories; Enter these arms, for since thou thought'st it best, Not to dream all my dream, let's act the rest.    As lightning, or a taper's light, Thine eyes, and not thy noise wak'd me;             Yet I thought thee (For thou lovest truth) an angel, at first sight; But when I saw thou sawest my heart, And knew'st my thoughts, beyond an angel's art, When thou knew'st what I dreamt, when thou knew'st when Excess of joy would wake me, and cam'st then, I must confess, it could not choose but be Profane, to think thee any thing but thee.    Coming and staying show'd thee, thee, But rising makes me doubt, that now             Thou art not thou. That love is weak where fear's as strong as he; 'Tis not all spirit, pure and brave, If mixture it of fear, shame, honour have; Perchance as torches, which must ready be, Men light and put out, so thou deal'st with me; Thou cam'st to kindle, goest to come; then I Will dream that hope again, but else would die.",happiness
"Before there was ""Showgirls"" there was ""Girl in Gold Boots"". This film is even worse and worse made. You know, I really think the director took himself seriously when he made this movie. Sad, is it not? But I think he didn't realize that he had a budget to stick to when making this movie.The plot? Michele is a wanna be dancer (who really can't dance, but we're lead to believe she's the best) but is unfortunately kept with her alcoholic father in the popular restaurant ""Eat"". But when a Kasey Kasim wanna be walks in with promises to make her a professional dancer with the help from his sister who is the ""main attraction"" in L.A., she leaves within the blink of an eye. On their way they pick up a hitchhiker, Critter. Of course there will be tension since everyone loves Michele's looks. When they finally arrive in L.A., and there is Christmas decorations all around Hollywood, where's a better place to go than a haunted house? But it's just a hidden dance joint where the dancers look like they're more having seizures and clucking like a chicken then dancing. Michele, Buz, and Critter get involved deeper than they would want in the business with a slick greasy pusher who owns the joint. When Buz's sister, Joanie, is obviously in bad shape from drugs and possibly overdosing on the fake eyelashes, she confesses that she once had a ""pretty mind"" and tells Michele to get out before Leo, the pusher, takes her down too. But can Critter and Michele make it alive when they already know too much about a plot and a murder that doesn't make much sense? Oh, man. You have no idea how poorly made this film was made, I mean we're talking just God-awful acting, poor sound, bad editing, atroshish writing, and a horrific picture. I just loved how in one scene, it's just Critter and Michele are sitting ALONE at a table, but in the blink of an eye Buz is in the picture. I loved MSTK3's commentary ""I'm back! Come on! I just teleported here! It's impressive!"". Watch the MSTK3 episode, that's the only way you'll enjoy the film.1/10 for the film 10/10 for MSTK3's version",happiness
"I couldn't bash ""Sex Drive"" in good faith. For a comedy of its type, and all of you know what I mean by this coming of age sort of comedy, it had a lot of slow parts that weren't funny, and needless sentimentality that only served to slow the movie down. However, when it was funny, it was super funny.The ongoing gags were pretty notable, and performances were top notch, notably by Seth Green as the sarcastic Amish guy. This may reign as best sarcastic performance in any movie, ever. The energy between the various performers was right and helped execute most of the gags effectively. As I mentioned, I have complaints, but they are trivial. If you want some goofy humor to eat popcorn to, give it a shot.",happiness

"I. AUBADE The dawn is here—and the long night through I have never seen thy face,Though my feet have worn the patient grass at the gate of thy dwelling-place.While the white moon sailed till, red in the west, it found the far world edge,       No leaflet stirred of the leaves that climb to garland thy window ledge.Yet the vine had quivered from root to tip, and opened its flowers again,If only the low moon's light had glanced on a moving casement pane.Warm was the wind that entered in where the barrier stood ajar,And the curtain shook with its gentle breath, white as young lilies are;But there came no hand all the slow night through to draw the folds aside,(I longed as the moon and the vine-leaves longed!) or to set the casement wide.Three times in a low-hung nest there dreamed his five sweet notes a bird,And thrice my heart leaped up at the sound I thought thou hadst surely heard.But now that thy praise is caroled aloud by a thousand throats awake,Shall I watch from afar and silently, as under the moon, for thy sake?Nay—bold in the sun I speak thy name, I too, and I wait no moreThy hand, thy face, in the window niche, but thy kiss at the open door!II. NOCTURNE My darling, come!—The wings of the dark have wafted the sunset away,And there's room for much in a summer night, but no room for delay.            A still moon looketh down from the sky, and a wavering moon looks upFrom every hollow in the green hills that holds a pool in its cup.The woodland borders are wreathed with bloom—elder, viburnum, rose; The young trees yearn on the breast of the wind that sighs of love as it goes.The small stars drown in the moon-washed blue but the greater ones abide,With Vega high in the midmost place, Altair not far aside.The glades are dusk, and soft the grass, where the flower of the elder gleams,Mist-white, moth-like, a spirit awake in the dark of forest dreams.Arcturus beckons into the east, Antares toward the south,That sendeth a zephyr sweet with thyme to seek for thy sweeter mouth.Shall the blossom wake, the star look down, all night and have naught to see?Shall the reeds that sing by the wind-brushed pool say nothing of thee and me?—My darling comes! My arms are content, my feet are guiding her way;There is room for much in a summer night, but no room for delay!",happiness
"While the credits roll, a young boy is chased to the edge of a cliff. He falls over the edge and looks dead...Two years later, we meet Southern California brunette Marguerite Moreau (as Emilie). She quits her job to spend more time with husband Richard Ruccolo (as Brian Valentine), their young daughter Natalie Lind (as Olive) and ""Hunter"" the family pooch. A new family moves in next door, from Denver. They are blonde single mom Abby (as Tamara) and her two sons, Julien Lacroix and Aidan Potter (as Titus and Billy Moor). This new family sends off creepy vibes, which irk Ms. Moreau. Her little girl has a ""first official crush"" on young rough-playing Potter. Moreau notices her neighbors have bruises and a man caught trespassing demands the return of his son...Of the cast, devoted mother Brammell is most engagingly mysterious. The younger children are more silly than intriguing; most parents would separate the mismatched pair before they separated themselves. Older son Lacroix uses his hair to play the moody, distant teenager. Director Andrew C. Erin keeps it moving, though. He and his crew effectively uses close-ups to have characters abruptly enter a scene, or has them slither around in the background. By the end of ""Playdate"" we have a sufficient idea about what has happened, but there are some details which remain too sketchy. Kraig Wenman's original story may have been trimmed. It's not incomplete, just vague.**** Playdate (2012-04-28) Andrew C. Erin ~ Marguerite Moreau, Abby Brammell, Richard Ruccolo, Julien Lacroix",happiness
"I was surprised to see that this movie was only rated a 4 by IMBD members. I loved this movie. Jamie Lee Curtis and John Travolta were very good in their roles. The double story lines about the MacKenzie and Health Clubs reports were very realistic and interesting.But I guess the real reason I liked this movie is because I decided two months ago to get into shape. I am already seeing amazing results and this movie with it's health club story and terrific soundtrack help keep me motivated. But even if you aren't currently involved in a fitness program you will find it impossible to keep from dancing to the music in this movie.

"This was a breakthrough performance for Jet Li. It was nice to see him get away from just being the amazing fighter, and seeing him in a little bit more of a serious role. Of course Morgan Freeman was simply brilliant, and Bob Hoskins did an amazing job as the villain. This movie had a lot less action than I had anticipated, but the story behind it makes it much better than any amount of action/violence could have. The theater was full of people laughing, gasping or being COMPLETELY silent as one. It was the perfect mix of action and comedy within a heartfelt story.I recommend this movie to any fan of any movie EVER!",happiness
"I get it that this is supposed to be a satire of romantic comedies. Every interview he does David Wain says that about 45 times. I would have preferred to see any of those ROMCOMs besides this. I don't know how he did it but he found a way to make me dislike Paul Rudd and Amy Poehler. That took real skill. And, the cinematography was dismal. It looked like they lit scenes with available overhead fluorescent lights. This is the worst film of 2014 so far. This seems like a SNL skit that lasted 110 minutes too long. I wish some of the other SNL players had more screen time. If I hear David Wain say ROMCOM one more time I am going to have an aneurysm.",happiness

"Written In True Mary Horowitz Style:Did you ever wonder HOW a Real person with a completely separate ""Public"" identity feels - say Charles Lindbergh whose child was stolen or Martin Luther King, Jr. whose front porch was bombed? There are Crazy people in this world - UTTERLY out of their mind crazy, mean and destructive...then there people like Mary: Kind, Gentle, Dorky and always trying to figure things out - yet still trying to find real love - just like everyone else. I thought Ms. Bullock's film was very compassionate, considerate and caring - An Excellent Comedy with Heart!The scene where the two friends show how many people Mary touched in a positive way, compared to how many the newscaster touched in a negative way was priceless and showed Mary's true nature and thus her true value. Something that Mary had to learn for herself and DOES. Learning to value yourself is a hard lesson and some people like, Marilyn Monroe, never quite get it and give up (but are so vain they take pictures before they do) and other's like the self-abdicated King of England get it right the first time - when true love hits them between the eye - yet still late in life (age 42):""But you must believe me when I tell you that I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King (of England) as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love."" - Edward the VIIIThe sad fact is that many of us are late bloomers and in this world ...

"This new comedic musical is right on pitch. Anna Kendrick plays Beca, a student at Barden University whose dream is to move to LA and become a DJ. Beca is uninterested in college, to say the least. Her father is a professor at her school and he advises her to join clubs to get more involved. Beca starts to work at the school radio station along with her admirer, Jesse (Skylar Astin).When Beca's voice is heard by Chloe (Brittany Snow), one of the main girls of The Barden Bellas a capella group, Beca is recruited into this singing group. Jesse ends up joining the rival all-boys a capella group called The Treble Makers.Beca soon realizes that The Bellas need some new music in order to improve their reputation and make it to the finals. However, the leader of the group, Aubrey (Anna Camp), is quite headstrong and refuses to change their music. The tension between these girls and The Treble Makers continues to grow and everything begins to unfold.Walking into this movie with very low expectations, I definitely was pleasantly surprised. It is a musical done right. There is no breaking out into song; the only time people sing is during competitions. In fact, the music is terrific and I can't wait to download the entire soundtrack.I was expecting slapstick comedy, especially with Rebel Wilson in the cast, but ""Pitch Perfect"" rests at the borderline. Speaking of Rebel, this movie would be nothing without her. Hilarious lines mixed with her perfect comedic timing equals a workout for your abs. It comes very close to stupidity but it doesn't quite cross the line.""Pitch Perfect"" is cute, silly, and fun. If you're looking for some laughs, take a watch. I give it a 7 out of 10.",happiness
"""Unrest"" is an overall fun, if pretty flawed film.**SPOILERS**Arriving for Anatomy Class, students Alison Blanchard, (Corri English) and her team, Brian Cross, (Scot Davis) and Carlos Aclar, (Joshua Alba) are confronted with a mysterious cadaver. As they continue on with the class, her personal beliefs conflict with the rest of the group, and it starts to disturb her. When she begins to feel that something is wrong with the body, it gets to her even more so and she starts to investigate. When the others get wind of what's going on, they try to find out what is going on, along with Dr. Walter Blackwell, (Derrick O'Connor) the head doctor. Finally able to understand the connection between the cadaver and the strange occurrences around the hospital, they are able to help it leave the hospital.The Good News: This one wasn't all that bad at times. The film's biggest point is that there's a really engaging mystery created with the cadaver. The fact that it's a complete unknown yet comes in several really burning questions which really should've been answered and doesn't. Those are quite good, but all the supernatural events is where the film shines. From all the weird chanting and buzzing noises to all the different objects around them breaking and smashing for no reason to the innate feeling of dread, this one really has a couple of outstanding suspense scenes. Once knowledge of the ancient curse comes in, this one gets even more creepy, and the film really gets going with the creepy feelings. The ending is also a big part of this, as it gets really creepy, as this segment also manages to throw in some really nice gore scenes as well. There's a leg lopped off with a power saw, another has incredibly brutal scratches across the back that leaves really deep scars, a few really great aftermath shots and much more. These are mixed in with the creepy feelings to create a series of really great sequences. These here are augmented by the really disturbing anatomy class scenes where the bodies are cut into. These are graphic, detailed and really do have a disturbing quality to them. These here are what the film works.The Bad News: This here doesn't have a whole lot of flaws. The biggest one is an issue brought up repeatedly in the film, which is why the students continually choose to live in the hospital knowing what is going on. There's several scenes that give the film a real sense that they don't have much sense. It's understandable when there's little to no information about the curse, but they're still in the building after knowing what had happened, and that's a really hard one to believe. They have an idea of what the curse can do, as it's been after them for awhile at that point, and finally getting any answer would've made it nearly impossible to stay there. It's brought up several times, making it even more ridiculous that it occurs. The only other one is that the film's reliance on mood could prove to be a missed opportunity for those who prefer a much more straight-forward action tale. By continually using creepy noises, it soon becomes blasé after a point, which could be a point against it. That could even be a pace-killing mark, as it could be seen as a series of such scenes and make it feel less interesting. These, though, are all it has against the film.The Final Verdict: Without a whole lot of really big flaws but still manages to get in a few other points for it. This is really only for those who are interested in the other films or think it sounds interesting, while those who not that interested in it should give it a shot without looking for too much.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Full Nudity",happiness

"This film reminds me of the first 'flick' our entire family went to see. Oh and the last. Condorman will only be a good film for those who remember times gone by. This is a very watchable family film but don't expect major laughs, especially with Michael Crawford's (Ooooh Betty) poor American accent. This was Disneys alternative to Superman with a splash of James Bond, and quite simply it was anything but. Please watch it so you can see how much storyboards, acting and special effects have progressed. If you like Porsche's chasing a gypsy waggon, then this is for you. If you are going to analyse this film for its kit-ch humour, and the directors/studio's desperation to get a film out for Summer, don't bother, however it is a way of introducing a spy film to your 3 year old.",happiness
"One of the best family movies ever made! Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt are excellent in this modern day adaption of the classic book by Frank B. Gilbreth Jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey. Although not faithful to the original, this movie keeps the spirit of the original in that it shows family as the most important thing while still laughing at the humor of everyday life.The supporting cast is excellent! All of the actors playing the Baker kids deliver excellent performances. Most notable are Hilary Duff (The Lizzie McGuire Show) and Tom Welling (Smallville). Hilary is great as always and gets to show that she has true potential as a dramatic actress. I'm not a big fan of Ashton Kutcher, but I must admit that he delivers an absolutely hilarious uncredited supporting part.This movie is a treat for any family. Most parents will find it acceptable for their kids. The only really offensive portion is some ""thematic elements"" involving the oldest 20-something daughter's living with a guy. This however is portrayed as an improper thing by her parents. Overall, an excellent and surprisingly clean movie. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone!",happiness

"Debutant Writer-Director Punit Malhotra's 'I Hate Luv Storys' is a pointless & predictable film, that is clichéd from the word go.Imran Khan stars as a guy who doesn't believe in LOVE. Entry, Sonam Kapoor who's a 'DDLJ' kinda a girl, who gives her heart to the anti-love youngster. Thus follows a series of events, of complications, jealousy and un-wanted emotional melodrama.'I Hate Luv Storys' is not a bad film, but in fact, a boring film. If the first-hour has it's moments, the second-hour plays a complete spoilsport. The culmination, is the weakest link. It doesn't evoke the emotion, as planned by the screenplay.Punit Malhotra's direction is decent, but his screenplay is a yawn. Ayananka Bose's Photography is striking, capturing the exotic locales of New Zealand with flourish. Editing is average. Vishal-Shekhar's Music is super.In the acting department, Imran Khan suits the part. Sonam Kapoor looks nice, but her performance, is flawed. Sameer Dattani is wasted in an insignificant role. Samir Soni does well as a show-off filmmaker. Aamir Ali gets it right. Bruna Abdullah looks alluring in a brief role. Kavin Dave is first-rate.On the whole, this flick didn't work for me.

"*sigh* Two words that describe this film. Missed opportunities.This movie should never have been made for PG-13, but R rating. But because it has been made for kids, this movie, and all that it could have achieved, is a huge wasted opportunity of gigantic proportions. Marvel was also hesitant to make Deadpool with R-rating, but they finally did, and it payed off.I hate all the mistakes DC are making these days. I grew up with batman and superman comics in the 80's and 90's, so it hurts when i see them treat their own material this way.Margot Robbie is the star of this film, she steals all the attention in every scene she is in, and i can not but imagine what she could have done with this character if it was not a movie for kids. A huge contrast to the rest of the cast assemble which has too little to do, and they are to many, so we don't ever get to like or dislike any of them. To top it off, the joker has far to few scenes in this film, which is a shame. Jared Leto plays a solid mad joker.And as i predicted before the movie came out, was that David Ayer would yet again fail. He and Fuqua both, are riding on the success they had with ""Training Day"", and IMO none of them have directed a good movie since then. Ayer is not a good story teller, he is good at blending action with CGI, which this movie could of had a lot less and rather spend time on the story. His direction, combined with a weak story, and combined with PG-13, disaster happens.And this is a movie that was so hyped as well. This was the one film DC had to do right, to prove they had it in them. The Marvel movie that kind of compare to this is ""Guardians of the galaxy"". And what Marvel did right was to give all the characters a unique and special personality, making it easier to recognize and care for them, which then made it a good movie. Here in ""Suicide squad"" we just have an outstanding Margot Robbie with a bunch of ""others"". Which is a damn shame.I heard before i saw the film that a lot of the Jokers scenes were cut out of the film before the final cut, i haven't read more into it. But The Joker had way to few scenes in this film, maybe the other scenes they had to remove weren't PG-13 friendly.*sigh* Why DC?. WHY?Is it so damn hard to make a R rated movie now and then? With an R rating, this movie would have dared to be as violent as it has to be with this assemble of anti heroes. The Joker can go full ballistic, Harley Quinn can be even more daring, The language even more naughty and provoking. It is all the movie needed to be decent or even good. But DC didn't have the brass balls needed to pull it off.Therefor just a big pile of missed opportunities.4/10 - Very Disappointing",happiness

I'm not a big fan of the lead and I normally do not like these types of films, but 30 minutes in I was won over (maybe it was all the animals).

"Don't go expecting a great movie, it's not.But it is also not ""the worst of the worst"" etc. It is uneven. There are jokes that might appeal to a 13 year old that are dreadfully stale and in poor taste for adults. The scriptwriter's sense of how a person becomes a doctor in the US is bizarre. I don't know if this matches Indian practice in some way but it certainly doesn't represent even a nodding acquaintance with the American hospital scene.The situations and language will not shock anyone used to US films, though they are probably fairly shocking for Bollywood, and I do not know to what extent the subtitles represented a taming of the language in Hindi. Someone complained about nudity--I don't count presumed nudity under sheets as nudity.That said, there are some nice moments, and a great sense of energy throughout. If you have high tolerance for silliness, this is fun. My husband who is not a Bollywood fan, enjoyed it.",happiness

"Lors dit en plourant; Hélas trop malheureux homme et mauldict pescheur, oncques ne verrai-je clémence et miséricorde de Dieu. Ores m'en irai-je d'icy et me cacherai dedans le mont Horsel, en requérant de faveur et d'amoureuse merci ma doulce dame Vénus, car pour son amour serai-je bien à  tout jamais damné en enfer. Voicy la fin de tous mes faicts d'armes et de toutes mes belles chansons. Hélas, trop belle estoyt la face de ma dame et ses yeulx, et en mauvais jour je vis ces chouses-là . Lors s'en alla tout en gémissant et se retourna chez elle, et là  vescut tristement en grand amour près de sa dame. Puis après advint que le pape vit un jour esclater sur son baston force belles fleurs rouges et blanches et maints boutons de feuilles, et ainsi vit-il reverdir toute l'escorce. Ce dont il eut grande crainte et moult s'en esmut, et grande pitié lui prit de ce chevalier qui s'en estoyt départi sans espoir comme un homme misérable et damné. Doncques envoya force messaigers devers luy pour le ramener, disant qu'il aurait de Dieu grace et bonne absolution de son grand pesché d'amour. Mais oncques plus ne le virent; car toujours demeura ce pauvre chevalier auprès de Vénus la haulte et forte déesse ès flancs de la montagne amoureuse.  Livre des grandes merveilles d'amour, escript en latin et en françoys par Maistre Antoine Gaget. 1530. Asleep or waking is it? for her neck, Kissed over close, wears yet a purple speck       Wherein the pained blood falters and goes out; Soft, and stung softly — fairer for a fleck. But though my lips shut sucking on the place, There is no vein at work upon her face;       Her eyelids are so peaceable, no doubt Deep sleep has warmed her blood through all its ways. Lo, this is she that was the world's delight; The old grey years were parcels of her might;       The strewings of the ways wherein she trod Were the twain seasons of the day and night. Lo, she was thus when her clear limbs enticed All lips that now grow sad with kissing Christ,       Stained with blood fallen from the feet of God, The feet and hands whereat our souls were priced. Alas, Lord, surely thou art great and fair. But lo her wonderfully woven hair!       And thou didst heal us with thy piteous kiss; But see now, Lord; her mouth is lovelier. She is right fair; what hath she done to thee? Nay, fair Lord Christ, lift up thine eyes and see;       Had now thy mother such a lip — like this? Thou knowest how sweet a thing it is to me. Inside the Horsel here the air is hot; Right little peace one hath for it, God wot;       The scented dusty daylight burns the air, And my heart chokes me till I hear it not. Behold, my Venus, my soul's body, lies With my love laid upon her garment-wise,       Feeling my love in all her limbs and hair And shed between her eyelids through her eyes. She holds my heart in her sweet open hands Hanging asleep; hard by her head there stands,       Crowned with gilt thorns and clothed with flesh like fire, love, wan as foam blown up the salt burnt sands — Hot as the brackish waifs of yellow spume That shift and steam — loose clots of arid fume       From the sea's panting mouth of dry desire; There stands he, like one labouring at a loom. The warp holds fast across; and every thread That makes the woof up has dry specks of red;       Always the shuttle cleaves clean through, and he Weaves with the hair of many a ruined head. love is not glad nor sorry, as I deem; Labouring he dreams, and labours in the dream,       Till when the spool is finished, lo I see His web, reeled off, curls and goes out like steam. Night falls like fire; the heavy lights run low, And as they drop, my blood and body so       Shake as the flame shakes, full of days and hours That sleep not neither weep they as they go. Ah yet would God this flesh of mine might be Where air might wash and long leaves cover me,       Where tides of grass break into foam of flowers, Or where the wind's feet shine along the sea. Ah yet would God that stems and roots were bred Out of my weary body and my head,       That sleep were sealed upon me with a seal, And I were as the least of all his dead. Would God my blood were dew to feed the grass, Mine ears made deaf and mine eyes blind as glass,       My body broken as a turning wheel, And my mouth stricken ere it saith Alas! Ah God, that love were as a flower or flame, That life were as the naming of a name,       That death were not more pitiful than desire, That these things were not one thing and the same! Behold now, surely somewhere there is death: For each man hath some space of years, he saith,       A little space of time ere time expire, A little day, a little way of breath. And lo, between the sundawn and the sun, His day's work and his night's work are undone;       And lo, between the nightfall and the light, He is not, and none knoweth of such an one. Ah God, that I were as all souls that be, As any herb or leaf of any tree,       As men that toil through hours of labouring night, As bones of men under the deep sharp sea. Outside it must be winter among men; For at the gold bars of the gates again       I heard all night and all the hours of it The wind's wet wings and fingers drip with rain. Knights gather, riding sharp for cold; I know The ways and woods are strangled with the snow;       And with short song the maidens spin and sit Until Christ's birthnight, lily-like, arow. The scent and shadow shed about me make The very soul in all my senses ache;       The hot hard night is fed upon my breath, And sleep beholds me from afar awake. Alas, but surely where the hills grow deep, Or where the wild ways of the sea are steep,       Or in strange places somewhere there is death, And on death's face the scattered hair of sleep. There lover-like with lips and limbs that meet They lie, they pluck sweet fruit of life and eat;       But me the hot and hungry days devour, And in my mouth no fruit of theirs is sweet. No fruit of theirs, but fruit of my desire, For her love's sake whose lips through mine respire;       Her eyelids on her eyes like flower on flower, Mine eyelids on mine eyes like fire on fire. So lie we, not as sleep that lies by death, With heavy kisses and with happy breath;       Not as man lies by woman, when the bride Laughs low for love's sake and the words he saith. For she lies, laughing low with love; she lies And turns his kisses on her lips to sighs,       To sighing sound of lips unsatisfied, And the sweet tears are tender with her eyes. Ah, not as they, but as the souls that were Slain in the old time, having found her fair;       Who, sleeping with her lips upon their eyes, Heard sudden serpents hiss across her hair. Their blood runs round the roots of time like rain: She casts them forth and gathers them again;       With nerve and bone she weaves and multiplies Exceeding pleasure out of extreme pain. Her little chambers drip with flower-like red, Her girdles, and the chaplets of her head,       Her armlets and her anklets; with her feet She tramples all that winepress of the dead. Her gateways smoke with fume of flowers and fires, With loves burnt out and unassuaged desires;       Between her lips the steam of them is sweet, The languor in her ears of many lyres. Her beds are full of perfume and sad sound, Her doors are made with music, and barred round       With sighing and with laughter and with tears, With tears whereby strong souls of men are bound. There is the knight Adonis that was slain; With flesh and blood she chains him for a chain;       The body and the spirit in her ears Cry, for her lips divide him vein by vein. Yea, all she slayeth; yea, every man save me; Me, love, thy lover that must cleave to thee       Till the ending of the days and ways of earth, The shaking of the sources of the sea. Me, most forsaken of all souls that fell; Me, satiated with things insatiable;       Me, for whose sake the extreme hell makes mirth, Yea, laughter kindles at the heart of hell. Alas thy beauty! for thy mouth's sweet sake My soul is bitter to me, my limbs quake       As water, as the flesh of men that weep, As their heart's vein whose heart goes nigh to break. Ah God, that sleep with flower-sweet finger-tips Would crush the fruit of death upon my lips;       Ah God, that death would tread the grapes of sleep And wring their juice upon me as it drips. There is no change of cheer for many days, But change of chimes high up in the air, that sways       Rung by the running fingers of the wind; And singing sorrows heard on hidden ways. Day smiteth day in twain, night sundereth night, And on mine eyes the dark sits as the light;       Yea, Lord, thou knowest I know not, having sinned, If heaven be clean or unclean in thy sight. Yea, as if earth were sprinkled over me, Such chafed harsh earth as chokes a sandy sea,       Each pore doth yearn, and the dried blood thereof Gasps by sick fits, my heart swims heavily, There is a feverish famine in my veins; Below her bosom, where a crushed grape stains       The white and blue, there my lips caught and clove An hour since, and what mark of me remains? I dare not always touch her, lest the kiss Leave my lips charred. Yea, Lord, a little bliss,       Brief bitter bliss, one hath for a great sin; Nathless thou knowest how sweet a thing it is. Sin, is it sin whereby men's souls are thrust Into the pit? yet had I a good trust       To save my soul before it slipped therein, Trod under by the fire-shod feet of lust. For if mine eyes fail and my soul takes breath, I look between the iron sides of death       Into sad hell where all sweet love hath end, All but the pain that never finisheth. There are the naked faces of great kings, The singing folk with all their lute-playings;       There when one cometh he shall have to friend The grave that covets and the worm that clings. There sit the knights that were so great of hand, The ladies that were queens of fair green land,       Grown grey and black now, brought unto the dust, Soiled, without raiment, clad about with sand. There is one end for all of them; they sit Naked and sad, they drink the dregs of it,       Trodden as grapes in the wine-press of lust, Trampled and trodden by the fiery feet. I see the marvellous mouth whereby there fell Cities and people whom the gods loved well,       Yet for her sake on them the fire gat hold, And for their sakes on her the fire of hell. And softer than the Egyptian lote-leaf is, The queen whose face was worth the world to kiss,       Wearing at breast a suckling snake of gold; And large pale lips of strong Semiramis, Curled like a tiger's that curl back to feed; Red only where the last kiss made them bleed;       Her hair most thick with many a carven gem, Deep in the mane, great-chested, like a steed. Yea, with red sin the faces of them shine; But in all these there was no sin like mine;       No, not in all the strange great sins of them That made the wine-press froth and foam with wine. For I was of Christ's choosing, I God's knight, No blinkard heathen stumbling for scant light;       I can well see, for all the dusty days Gone past, the clean great time of goodly fight. I smell the breathing battle sharp with blows, With shriek of shafts and snapping short of bows;       The fair pure sword smites out in subtle ways, Sounds and long lights are shed between the rows Of beautiful mailed men; the edged light slips, Most like a snake that takes short breath and dips       Sharp from the beautifully bending head, With all its gracious body lithe as lips That curl in touching you; right in this wise My sword doth, seeming fire in mine own eyes,       Leaving all colours in them brown and red And flecked with death; then the keen breaths like sighs, The caught-up choked dry laughters following them, When all the fighting face is grown a flame       For pleasure, and the pulse that stuns the ears, And the heart's gladness of the goodly game. Let me think yet a little; I do know These things were sweet, but sweet such years ago,       Their savour is all turned now into tears; Yea, ten years since, where the blue ripples blow, The blue curled eddies of the blowing Rhine, I felt the sharp wind shaking grass and vine       Touch my blood too, and sting me with delight Through all this waste and weary body of mine That never feels clear air; right gladly then I rode alone, a great way off my men,       And heard the chiming bridle smite and smite, And gave each rhyme thereof some rhyme again, Till my song shifted to that iron one; Seeing there rode up between me and the sun       Some certain of my foe's men, for his three White wolves across their painted coats did run. The first red-bearded, with square cheeks — alack, I made my knave's blood turn his beard to black;       The slaying of him was a joy to see: Perchance too, when at night he came not back, Some woman fell a-weeping, whom this thief Would beat when he had drunken; yet small grief       Hath any for the ridding of such knaves; Yea, if one wept, I doubt her teen was brief. This bitter love is sorrow in all lands, Draining of eyelids, wringing of drenched hands,       Sighing of hearts and filling up of graves; A sign across the head of the world he stands, An one that hath a plague-mark on his brows; Dust and spilt blood do track him to his house       Down under earth; sweet smells of lip and cheek, Like a sweet snake's breath made more poisonous With chewing of some perfumed deadly grass, Are shed all round his passage if he pass,       And their quenched savour leaves the whole soul weak, Sick with keen guessing whence the perfume was. As one who hidden in deep sedge and reeds Smells the rare scent made where a panther feeds,       And tracking ever slotwise the warm smell Is snapped upon by the sweet mouth and bleeds, His head far down the hot sweet throat of her — So one tracks love, whose breath is deadlier,       And lo, one springe and you are fast in hell, Fast as the gin's grip of a wayfarer. I think now, as the heavy hours decease One after one, and bitter thoughts increase       One upon one, of all sweet finished things; The breaking of the battle; the long peace Wherein we sat clothed softly, each man's hair Crowned with green leaves beneath white hoods of vair;       The sounds of sharp spears at great tourneyings, And noise of singing in the late sweet air. I sang of love too, knowing nought thereof; ""Sweeter,"" I said, ""the little laugh of love       Than tears out of the eyes of Magdalen, Or any fallen feather of the Dove. ""The broken little laugh that spoils a kiss, The ache of purple pulses, and the bliss       Of blinded eyelids that expand again — love draws them open with those lips of his, ""Lips that cling hard till the kissed face has grown Of one same fire and colour with their own;       Then ere one sleep, appeased with sacrifice, Where his lips wounded, there his lips atone."" I sang these things long since and knew them not; ""Lo, here is love, or there is love, God wot,       This man and that finds favour in his eyes,"" I said, ""but I, what guerdon have I got? ""The dust of praise that is blown everywhere In all men's faces with the common air;       The bay-leaf that wants chafing to be sweet Before they wind it in a singer's hair."" So that one dawn I rode forth sorrowing; I had no hope but of some evil thing,       And so rode slowly past the windy wheat And past the vineyard and the water-spring, Up to the Horsel. A great elder-tree Held back its heaps of flowers to let me see       The ripe tall grass, and one that walked therein, Naked, with hair shed over to the knee. She walked between the blossom and the grass; I knew the beauty of her, what she was,       The beauty of her body and her sin, And in my flesh the sin of hers, alas! Alas! for sorrow is all the end of this. O sad kissed mouth, how sorrowful it is!       O breast whereat some suckling sorrow clings, Red with the bitter blossom of a kiss! Ah, with blind lips I felt for you, and found About my neck your hands and hair enwound,       The hands that stifle and the hair that stings, I felt them fasten sharply without sound. Yea, for my sin I had great store of bliss: Rise up, make answer for me, let thy kiss       Seal my lips hard from speaking of my sin, Lest one go mad to hear how sweet it is. Yet I waxed faint with fume of barren bowers, And murmuring of the heavy-headed hours;       And let the dove's beak fret and peck within My lips in vain, and love shed fruitless flowers. So that God looked upon me when your hands Were hot about me; yea, God brake my bands       To save my soul alive, and I came forth Like a man blind and naked in strange lands That hears men laugh and weep, and knows not whence Nor wherefore, but is broken in his sense;       Howbeit I met folk riding from the north Towards Rome, to purge them of their souls' offence, And rode with them, and spake to none; the day Stunned me like lights upon some wizard way,       And ate like fire mine eyes and mine eyesight; So rode I, hearing all these chant and pray, And marvelled; till before us rose and fell White cursed hills, like outer skirts of hell       Seen where men's eyes look through the day to night, Like a jagged shell's lips, harsh, untunable, Blown in between by devils' wrangling breath; Nathless we won well past that hell and death,       Down to the sweet land where all airs are good, Even unto Rome where God's grace tarrieth. Then came each man and worshipped at his knees Who in the Lord God's likeness bears the keys       To bind or loose, and called on Christ's shed blood, And so the sweet-souled father gave him ease. But when I came I fell down at his feet, Saying, ""Father, though the Lord's blood be right sweet,       The spot it takes not off the panther's skin, Nor shall an Ethiop's stain be bleached with it. ""Lo, I have sinned and have spat out at God, Wherefore his hand is heavier and his rod       More sharp because of mine exceeding sin, And all his raiment redder than bright blood ""Before mine eyes; yea, for my sake I wot The heat of hell is waxen seven times hot       Through my great sin."" Then spake he some sweet word, Giving me cheer; which thing availed me not; Yea, scarce I wist if such indeed were said; For when I ceased — lo, as one newly dead       Who hears a great cry out of hell, I heard The crying of his voice across my head. ""Until this dry shred staff, that hath no whit Of leaf nor bark, bear blossom and smell sweet,       Seek thou not any mercy in God's sight, For so long shalt thou be cast out from it."" Yea, what if dried-up stems wax red and green, Shall that thing be which is not nor has been?       Yea, what if sapless bark wax green and white, Shall any good fruit grow upon my sin? Nay, though sweet fruit were plucked of a dry tree, And though men drew sweet waters of the sea,       There should not grow sweet leaves on this dead stem, This waste wan body and shaken soul of me. Yea, though God search it warily enough, There is not one sound thing in all thereof;       Though he search all my veins through, searching them He shall find nothing whole therein but love. For I came home right heavy, with small cheer, And lo my love, mine own soul's heart, more dear       Than mine own soul, more beautiful than God, Who hath my being between the hands of her — Fair still, but fair for no man saving me, As when she came out of the naked sea       Making the foam as fire whereon she trod, And as the inner flower of fire was she. Yea, she laid hold upon me, and her mouth Clove unto mine as soul to body doth,       And, laughing, made her lips luxurious; Her hair had smells of all the sunburnt south, Strange spice and flower, strange savour of crushed fruit, And perfume the swart kings tread underfoot       For pleasure when their minds wax amorous, Charred frankincense and grated sandal-root. And I forgot fear and all weary things, All ended prayers and perished thanksgivings,       Feeling her face with all her eager hair Cleave to me, clinging as a fire that clings To the body and to the raiment, burning them; As after death I know that such-like flame       Shall cleave to me for ever; yea, what care, Albeit I burn then, having felt the same? Ah love, there is no better life than this; To have known love, how bitter a thing it is,       And afterward be cast out of God's sight; Yea, these that know not, shall they have such bliss High up in barren heaven before his face As we twain in the heavy-hearted place,       Remembering love and all the dead delight, And all that time was sweet with for a space? For till the thunder in the trumpet be, Soul may divide from body, but not we       One from another; I hold thee with my hand, I let mine eyes have all their will of thee, I seal myself upon thee with my might, Abiding alway out of all men's sight       Until God loosen over sea and land The thunder of the trumpets of the night.",happiness

"Oliver Tobias plays Tony Blake; plaything to the wealthy ladies of the decadent London disco club scene. Tony is a working class guy, trying to climb the ladder of fortune and success, by using his sexy looks and charm. Unfortunately the hustler is no match for female hustler, lady-shark Fontaine Khalad, played to perfection by Joan Collins. And when Tony begins to have real romantic feelings for Fontaine's teenage stepdaughter, it's the beginning of the end for our anti-hero. ""The Stud"" is an amazing time capsule, a vivid documentation of a decadent decade where disco and drugs were King. Surprisingly atmospheric, as well as effectively seedy and depressing, but it really has a heart when it comes to showing the rise and fall of Tony Blake. He is the perfect British ""working class hero,"" who turns out to be more noble than any of the high society people that feed on him and throw him to the wolves. This is no ""Boogie Nights,"" or ""54,"" it is the real deal. The soundtrack is impressive, and it is a wonder how they got permission to use all these very popular songs for the production; this movie was apparently a very big deal at the time, and a big hit too. Collins is wonderful in her role as the jaded, two-timing bitch, but it is Oliver Tobias who gives this film it's soul. Followed by a sequel, ""The Bitch,"" but this is by far the better film. Recommended for fans of 70's exploitation films. For those who believe the 70's were a happy and innocent time, see ""The Stud."" It really shatters that myth..",happiness

"Side by side through the streets at midnight, Roaming together, Through the tumultuous night of London, In the miraculous April weather. Roaming together under the gaslight, Day’s work over, How the Spring calls to us, here in the city, Calls to the heart from the heart of a lover! Cool to the wind blows, fresh in our faces, Cleansing, entrancing, After the heat and the fumes and the footlights, Where you dance and I watch your dancing. Good it is to be here together, Good to be roaming, Even in London, even at midnight, lover-like in a lover’s gloaming. You the dancer and I the dreamer, Children together, Wandering lost in the night of London, In the miraculous April weather. ﻿",happiness

"Dans l'adversité de nos meilleurs amis nous trouvons quelque chose, qui ne nous déplaît pas. [""In the hard times of our best friends we find something that doesn't displease us.""] As Rochefoucauld his maxims drew From Nature, I believe 'em true: They argue no corrupted mind In him; the fault is in mankind.        This maxim more than all the rest Is thought too base for human breast: ""In all distresses of our friends, We first consult our private ends; While Nature, kindly bent to ease us, Points out some circumstance to please us.""        If this perhaps your patience move, Let reason and experience prove.        We all behold with envious eyes Our equal rais'd above our size. Who would not at a crowded show Stand high himself, keep others low? I love my friend as well as you But would not have him stop my view. Then let him have the higher post: I ask but for an inch at most.        If in a battle you should find One, whom you love of all mankind, Had some heroic action done, A champion kill'd, or trophy won; Rather than thus be overtopt, Would you not wish his laurels cropt?        Dear honest Ned is in the gout, Lies rack'd with pain, and you without: How patiently you hear him groan! How glad the case is not your own!        What poet would not grieve to see His brethren write as well as he? But rather than they should excel, He'd wish his rivals all in hell.        Her end when emulation misses, She turns to envy, stings and hisses: The strongest friendship yields to pride, Unless the odds be on our side.        Vain human kind! fantastic race! Thy various follies who can trace? Self-love, ambition, envy, pride, Their empire in our hearts divide. Give others riches, power, and station, 'Tis all on me a usurpation. I have no title to aspire; Yet, when you sink, I seem the higher. In Pope I cannot read a line, But with a sigh I wish it mine; When he can in one couplet fix More sense than I can do in six; It gives me such a jealous fit, I cry, ""Pox take him and his wit!""        Why must I be outdone by Gay In my own hum'rous biting way?        Arbuthnot is no more my friend, Who dares to irony pretend, Which I was born to introduce, Refin'd it first, and show'd its use.        St. John, as well as Pultney, knows That I had some repute for prose; And, till they drove me out of date, Could maul a minister of state. If they have mortify'd my pride, And made me throw my pen aside; If with such talents Heav'n has blest 'em, Have I not reason to detest 'em?        To all my foes, dear Fortune, send Thy gifts; but never to my friend: I tamely can endure the first, But this with envy makes me burst.        Thus much may serve by way of proem: Proceed we therefore to our poem.        The time is not remote, when I Must by the course of nature die; When I foresee my special friends Will try to find their private ends: Tho' it is hardly understood Which way my death can do them good, Yet thus, methinks, I hear 'em speak: ""See, how the Dean begins to break! Poor gentleman, he droops apace! You plainly find it in his face. That old vertigo in his head Will never leave him till he's dead. Besides, his memory decays: He recollects not what he says; He cannot call his friends to mind: Forgets the place where last he din'd; Plies you with stories o'er and o'er; He told them fifty times before. How does he fancy we can sit To hear his out-of-fashion'd wit? But he takes up with younger folks, Who for his wine will bear his jokes. Faith, he must make his stories shorter, Or change his comrades once a quarter: In half the time he talks them round, There must another set be found.        ""For poetry he's past his prime: He takes an hour to find a rhyme; His fire is out, his wit decay'd, His fancy sunk, his Muse a jade. I'd have him throw away his pen;— But there's no talking to some men!""        And then their tenderness appears, By adding largely to my years: ""He's older than he would be reckon'd And well remembers Charles the Second.        ""He hardly drinks a pint of wine; And that, I doubt, is no good sign. His stomach too begins to fail: Last year we thought him strong and hale; But now he's quite another thing: I wish he may hold out till spring.""        Then hug themselves, and reason thus: ""It is not yet so bad with us.""        In such a case, they talk in tropes, And by their fears express their hopes: Some great misfortune to portend, No enemy can match a friend. With all the kindness they profess, The merit of a lucky guess (When daily ""How d'ye's"" come of course, And servants answer, ""Worse and worse!"") Would please 'em better, than to tell, That, ""God be prais'd, the Dean is well."" Then he who prophecy'd the best Approves his foresight to the rest: ""You know I always fear'd the worst, And often told you so at first."" He'd rather choose that I should die, Than his prediction prove a lie. Not one foretells I shall recover; But all agree to give me over.        Yet, should some neighbour feel a pain Just in the parts where I complain, How many a message would he send? What hearty prayers that I should mend? Inquire what regimen I kept, What gave me ease, and how I slept? And more lament when I was dead, Than all the sniv'llers round my bed.        My good companions, never fear; For though you may mistake a year, Though your prognostics run too fast, They must be verify'd at last.        Behold the fatal day arrive! ""How is the Dean?""—""He's just alive."" Now the departing prayer is read; ""He hardly breathes.""—""The Dean is dead."" Before the passing-bell begun, The news thro' half the town has run. ""O, may we all for death prepare! What has he left? and who's his heir?""— ""I know no more than what the news is; 'Tis all bequeath'd to public uses.""— ""To public use! a perfect whim! What had the public done for him? Mere envy, avarice, and pride: He gave it all—but first he died. And had the Dean, in all the nation, No worthy friend, no poor relation? So ready to do strangers good, Forgetting his own flesh and blood?""        Now Grub-Street wits are all employ'd; With elegies the town is cloy'd: Some paragraph in ev'ry paper To curse the Dean or bless the Drapier.        The doctors, tender of their fame, Wisely on me lay all the blame: ""We must confess his case was nice; But he would never take advice. Had he been rul'd, for aught appears, He might have liv'd these twenty years; For, when we open'd him, we found That all his vital parts were sound.""        From Dublin soon to London spread, 'Tis told at Court, the Dean is dead.        Kind Lady Suffolk in the spleen Runs laughing up to tell the Queen. The Queen, so gracious, mild, and good, Cries, ""Is he gone! 'tis time he should. He's dead, you say; why, let him rot: I'm glad the medals were forgot. I promis'd them, I own; but when? I only was the Princess then; But now, as consort of a king, You know, 'tis quite a different thing.""        Now Chartres, at Sir Robert's levee, Tells with a sneer the tidings heavy: ""Why, is he dead without his shoes?"" Cries Bob, ""I'm sorry for the news: O, were the wretch but living still, And in his place my good friend Will! Or had a mitre on his head, Provided Bolingbroke were dead!""        Now Curll his shop from rubbish drains: Three genuine tomes of Swift's remains! And then, to make them pass the glibber, Revis'd by Tibbalds, Moore, and Cibber. He'll treat me as he does my betters, Publish my will, my life, my letters: Revive the libels born to die; Which Pope must bear, as well as I.        Here shift the scene, to represent How those I love my death lament. Poor Pope will grieve a month, and Gay A week, and Arbuthnot a day.        St. John himself will scarce forbear To bite his pen, and drop a tear. The rest will give a shrug, and cry, ""I'm sorry—but we all must die!"" Indifference, clad in Wisdom's guise, All fortitude of mind supplies: For how can stony bowels melt In those who never pity felt? When  we are lash'd,  they kiss the rod, Resigning to the will of God.        The fools, my juniors by a year, Are tortur'd with suspense and fear; Who wisely thought my age a screen, When death approach'd, to stand between: The screen remov'd, their hearts are trembling; They mourn for me without dissembling.        My female friends, whose tender hearts Have better learn'd to act their parts, Receive the news in doleful dumps: ""The Dean is dead: (and what is trumps?) Then, Lord have mercy on his soul! (Ladies, I'll venture for the vole.) Six deans, they say, must bear the pall: (I wish I knew what king to call.) Madam, your husband will attend The funeral of so good a friend. No, madam, 'tis a shocking sight: And he's engag'd to-morrow night: My Lady Club would take it ill, If he should fail her at quadrille. He lov'd the Dean—(I lead a heart) But dearest friends, they say, must part. His time was come: he ran his race; We hope he's in a better place.""        Why do we grieve that friends should die? No loss more easy to supply. One year is past; a different scene! No further mention of the Dean; Who now, alas! no more is miss'd, Than if he never did exist. Where's now this fav'rite of Apollo! Departed:—and his works must follow; Must undergo the common fate; His kind of wit is out of date. Some country squire to Lintot goes, Inquires for ""Swift in Verse and Prose."" Says Lintot, ""I have heard the name; He died a year ago.""—""The same."" He searcheth all his shop in vain. ""Sir, you may find them in Duck-lane; I sent them with a load of books, Last Monday to the pastry-cook's. To fancy they could live a year! I find you're but a stranger here. The Dean was famous in his time, And had a kind of knack at rhyme. His way of writing now is past; The town hath got a better taste; I keep no antiquated stuff, But spick and span I have enough. Pray do but give me leave to show 'em; Here's Colley Cibber's birth-day poem. This ode you never yet have seen, By Stephen Duck, upon the Queen. Then here's a letter finely penn'd Against the  Craftsman and his friend: It clearly shows that all reflection On ministers is disaffection. Next, here's Sir Robert's vindication, And Mr. Henley's last oration. The hawkers have not got 'em yet: Your honour please to buy a set?        ""Here's Woolston's tracts, the twelfth edition; 'Tis read by every politician: The country members, when in town, To all their boroughs send them down; You never met a thing so smart; The courtiers have them all by heart: Those maids of honour who can read Are taught to use them for their creed. The rev'rend author's good intention Hath been rewarded with a pension. He doth an honour to his gown, By bravely running priestcraft down: He shows, as sure as God's in Gloucester, That Jesus was a grand imposter; That all his miracles were cheats, Perform'd as jugglers do their feats: The church had never such a writer; A shame he hath not got a mitre!""        Suppose me dead; and then suppose A club assembled at the  Rose ; Where, from discourse of this and that, I grow the subject of their chat. And while they toss my name about, With favour some, and some without, One, quite indiff'rent in the cause, My character impartial draws:        ""The Dean, if we believe report, Was never ill receiv'd at Court. As for his works in verse and prose I own myself no judge of those; Nor can I tell what critics thought 'em: But this I know, all people bought 'em. As with a moral view design'd To cure the vices of mankind: His vein, ironically grave, Expos'd the fool, and lash'd the knave. To steal a hint was never known, But what he writ was all his own.        ""He never thought an honour done him, Because a duke was proud to own him, Would rather slip aside and choose To talk with wits in dirty shoes; Despis'd the fools with stars and garters, So often seen caressing Chartres. He never courted men in station, Nor persons held in admiration; Of no man's greatness was afraid, Because he sought for no man's aid. Though trusted long in great affairs He gave himself no haughty airs: Without regarding private ends, Spent all his credit for his friends; And only chose the wise and good; No flatt'rers; no allies in blood: But succour'd virtue in distress, And seldom fail'd of good success; As numbers in their hearts must own, Who, but for him, had been unknown.        ""With princes kept a due decorum, But never stood in awe before 'em. He follow'd David's lesson just: 'In princes never put thy trust'; And, would you make him truly sour, Provoke him with a slave in pow'r. The Irish senate if you nam'd, With what impatience he declaim'd! Fair Liberty was all his cry, For her he stood prepar'd to die; For her he boldly stood alone; For her he oft expos'd his own. Two kingdoms, just as faction led, Had set a price upon his head; But not a traitor could be found To sell him for six hundred pound.        ""Had he but spar'd his tongue and pen He might have rose like other men: But pow'r was never in his thought, And wealth he valu'd not a groat: Ingratitude he often found, And pity'd those who meant the wound: But kept the tenor of his mind, To merit well of human kind: Nor made a sacrifice of those Who still were true, to please his foes. He labour'd many a fruitless hour To reconcile his friends in pow'r; Saw mischief by a faction brewing, While they pursu'd each other's ruin. But, finding vain was all his care, He left the Court in mere despair.        ""And, oh! how short are human schemes! Here ended all our golden dreams. What St. John's skill in state affairs, What Ormond's valour, Oxford's cares, To save their sinking country lent, Was all destroy'd by one event. Too soon that precious life was ended, On which alone our weal depended. When up a dangerous faction starts, With wrath and vengeance in their hearts; By solemn League and Cov'nant bound, To ruin, slaughter, and confound; To turn religion to a fable, And make the government a Babel; Pervert the law, disgrace the gown, Corrupt the senate, rob the crown; To sacrifice old England's glory, And make her infamous in story: When such a tempest shook the land, How could unguarded Virtue stand?        ""With horror, grief, despair, the Dean Beheld the dire destructive scene: His friends in exile, or the tower, Himself within the frown of power, Pursu'd by base envenom'd pens, Far to the land of slaves and fens; A servile race in folly nurs'd, Who truckle most when treated worst.        ""By innocence and resolution, He bore continual persecution, While numbers to preferment rose, Whose merits were, to be his foes; When ev'n his own familiar friends, Intent upon their private ends, Like renegadoes now he feels, Against him lifting up their heels.        ""The Dean did by his pen defeat An infamous destructive cheat; Taught fools their int'rest how to know, And gave them arms to ward the blow. Envy hath own'd it was his doing, To save that helpless land from ruin; While they who at the steerage stood, And reap'd the profit, sought his blood.        ""To save them from their evil fate, In him was held a crime of state. A wicked monster on the bench, Whose fury blood could never quench, As vile and profligate a villain, As modern Scroggs, or old Tresilian, Who long all justice had discarded, Nor fear'd he God, nor man regarded, Vow'd on the Dean his rage to vent, And make him of his zeal repent; But Heav'n his innocence defends, The grateful people stand his friends. Not strains of law, nor judge's frown, Nor topics brought to please the crown, Nor witness hir'd, nor jury pick'd, Prevail to bring him in convict.        ""In exile, with a steady heart, He spent his life's declining part; Where folly, pride, and faction sway, Remote from St. John, Pope, and Gay.        ""His friendships there, to few confin'd, Were always of the middling kind; No fools of rank, a mongrel breed, Who fain would pass for lords indeed: Where titles gave no right or power And peerage is a wither'd flower; He would have held it a disgrace, If such a wretch had known his face. On rural squires, that kingdom's bane, He vented oft his wrath in vain; Biennial squires to market brought; Who sell their souls and votes for nought; The nation stripp'd, go joyful back, To rob the church, their tenants rack, Go snacks with thieves and rapparees, And keep the peace to pick up fees; In ev'ry job to have a share, A jail or barrack to repair; And turn the tax for public roads, Commodious to their own abodes.        ""Perhaps I may allow, the Dean Had too much satire in his vein; And seem'd determin'd not to starve it, Because no age could more deserve it. Yet malice never was his aim; He lash'd the vice, but spar'd the name; No individual could resent, Where thousands equally were meant. His satire points at no defect, But what all mortals may correct; For he abhorr'd that senseless tribe Who call it humour when they gibe. He spar'd a hump, or crooked nose, Whose owners set not up for beaux. True genuine dulness mov'd his pity, Unless it offer'd to be witty. Those who their ignorance confess'd He ne'er offended with a jest; But laugh'd to hear an idiot quote A verse from Horace, learn'd by rote.        ""He knew a hundred pleasant stories With all the turns of Whigs and Tories: Was cheerful to his dying day; And friends would let him have his way.        ""He gave the little wealth he had To build a house for fools and mad; And show'd by one satiric touch, No nation wanted it so much. That kingdom he hath left his debtor, I wish it soon may have a better.""",happiness
@Sillyzombie666 @Dell I'm just glad they're doing something.,happiness
"Not all films made in 1931 are this creaky, and the fact that this was ""Best Picture"" must have given even greater impetus to the development of television.Typical of all Ferber novels, it isn't possible to bring the entire story to the screen, to say nothing of developing character. Dix -- so stolid in the first third of the movie -- does an about face, but no one knows why and it makes no sense. And what is there about Dunne that makes makes her so stoical? Edna May Oliver's scenes are priceless, as usual.This film has a role to play in the history of cinema, but it is long and boring.",happiness
i feel graceful and almost mythical,happiness
